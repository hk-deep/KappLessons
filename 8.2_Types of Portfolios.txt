ImagePage¤Types of Portfolios@-1/&0/There are a handful of different types of investment portfolios. Each type relates to a specific investment goal or strategy, and to a level of comfort with risk :@0@-1/&0/You don't need to stick to just one of these strategies. A well-diversified portfolio can include a mix of growth, dividend, value, and conservative stocks.@@@
TextPage¤Growth Portfolio@-1/&0/A growth portfolio, also known as an aggressive portfolio, involves taking on a greater level of financial risk in exchange for the chance of a greater return. @-1/&0/Many growth investors seek out newer companies that need capital and have room to grow, rather than older and more stable companies with proven track records (and less room to grow).@-1/&0/Investors in growth portfolios are willing to handle short-term fluctuations in the underlying value of their holdings if it means there is more potential for long-term capital gain. This type of portfolio is ideal if you have a high risk tolerance, or if you want to invest for the long-term.@@@
TextPage¤Income Portfolio@-1/&0/An income portfolio is built with a focus on creating recurring passive income. @-1/&0/Rather than seeking out investments that might result in the greatest long-term capital gain, investors look for investments that pay steady dividends with low risk to the underlying assets that earn those dividends. This type of portfolio is ideal if you are risk-averse, or if you plan to invest with a short to medium time horizon.@@@
TextPage¤Value Portfolio@-1/&0/A value portfolio is made up of value stocks, or stocks that are priced low compared with the company’s overall financial picture. @-1/&0/Value investors buy those underpriced stocks, then hold them as the price rises. Rather than focusing on income-generating stocks, investors with a value portfolio buy stocks to hold them for an extended period with the goal of long-term growth. @-1/&0/This type of portfolio is ideal if you have a moderate risk tolerance and a long time horizon.@@@
TextPage¤Conservative Portfolio@-1/&0/A conservative stock is one with relatively low volatility in an industry or sector that tends to remain mostly stable, in spite of changes in the broader market. In other words, conservative stocks represent those companies whose products are always in demand, no matter the state of the economy. @-1/&0/A conservative portfolio is made up of low-volatility stocks with the intent to limit losses in a market downturn. @-1/&0/Conservative portfolios often have lower risk and lower potential rewards. These portfolios work well for long time horizons, because they lead to smaller but sustained growth.@@@
TextPage¤Balanced Portfolio@-1/&0/A balanced portfolio is one of the most common options investors use. @-1/&0/The purpose of this type of portfolio is to reduce volatility. It mostly contains income-generating, moderate-growth stocks, as well as a large portion of bonds. The mix of stocks and bonds can help you to reduce risk no matter which way the market is moving. @-1/&0/This type of portfolio is ideal for someone with a low to moderate risk tolerance and a mid- to long-range time horizon.@@@
