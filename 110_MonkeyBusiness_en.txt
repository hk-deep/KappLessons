TextPage¤Risk & Return@-1/&0/In 1973, Princeton professor Burton Malkiel claimed in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a financial newspaper could build a stock portfolio that performs just as well as one carefully selected by experts. @-1/&0/Surprisingly, real-world simulations have shown that randomly chosen portfolios have often outperformed both professional investors and the broader market.@@@
ImagePage¤Monkey Business@-1/&0/As it happens someone was crazy enough to actually test the hypothesis. They randomly selected 100 portfolios of 30 stocks from a universe of 1,000 stocks. They repeated this process every year from 1964 to 2010, mimicking 100 monkeys selecting stocks annually. @0@-1/&0/The results were astonishing—on average, 98 out of the 100 monkey portfolios outperformed the market index each year.@
TextPage¤MonkeyBusiness@-1/&0/Before running down to the local pet store and ordering your dart-throwing monkey, consider the other side of the story. The study found that from 1964 to 2011, the 1,000-stock universe had an annualized return of 9.7%. @-1/&0/However, the 30 largest companies, which made up about 40% of the market capitalization, returned only 8.6% annually. In contrast, the smaller 970 stocks, which represented 60% of the capitalization, returned 10.5% annually. This suggests that smaller stocks historically offered a higher return compared to large-cap stocks.@-1/&0/Since a randomly selected portfolio of 30 stocks is more likely to include smaller companies, it naturally benefited from their higher returns. This explains why Malkiel’s hypothetical monkey portfolios consistently outperformed the market. @@
TextPage¤Monkey Business@-1/&0/However, investors should be cautious before assuming this strategy is foolproof. While small-cap stocks tend to offer higher returns, they also come with increased risk and volatility.@-1/&0/Investing isn’t just about picking stocks at random—it’s about managing risk. Portfolios that tilt toward small-cap and value stocks may achieve higher returns, but they also expose investors to greater market fluctuations. There’s no guaranteed way to consistently beat the market without taking on extra risk.@-1/&0/Ultimately, rather than relying on stock-picking—whether by monkeys or human experts—investors may be better off with a well-diversified index fund strategy. A portfolio built on index funds across multiple asset classes has a higher probability of long-term success than trying to outperform the market through active stock selection.@@@
ImagePage¤Monkey Business@-1/&0/So this brings 2 questions : @1@-1/&0/1. Is it possible to beat the market ?#2. Are professional advisors any good at all ?#We hope you’ll find the answer further down the app.@
