TextPage¤Risk & Return@-1/&0/Markets are so good at adjusting to new information that no one can predict their future course. @-1/&0/Because of the actions of investors, the prices of individual stocks quickly reflect all the news that is available.# Thus, the odds of selecting winning stocks or anticipating the general direction of the market are even. Your guess is as good as your stockbroker’s, or that of a monkey throwing darts.@@@
TextPage¤MonkeyBusiness@-1/&0/Princeton University professor Burton Malkiel claimed in his bestselling book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, that “A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.” @-1/&0/@-1/&0/@@
TextPage¤Monkey Business@-1/&0/As it happens, someone was crazy enough to actually test the hypothesis. They randomly selected 100 portfolios containing 30 stocks from a 1,000-stock universe. They repeated this process every year, from 1964 to 2010, and tracked the results. @-1/&0/The process replicated 100 monkeys throwing darts at the stock pages each year. Amazingly, on average, 98 of the 100 monkey portfolios beat the 1,000 stock capitalization weighted stock universe each year.@-1/&0/ So this brings 2 questions :# 1. Is it possible to beat the market ?# 2. Are professional advisors any good at all ?@@@
