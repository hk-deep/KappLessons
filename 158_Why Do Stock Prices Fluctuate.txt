ListPage¤Why Do Stock Prices Fluctuate@-1/&0/@-1/&0/Stock prices fluctuate frequently, increasing and decreasing in value in a single trading day. Novice investors may wonder why that is the case.@-1/&0/@-1/&0/To help you understand, remember that :@-1/&0/- The stock market is essentially an auction in which buyers and sellers negotiate prices for shares@-1/&0/- Like any other market, supply and demand is the primary factor driving the price of stocks.@-1/&0/- Other factors, such as major financial news, natural disasters, investor reaction to company financials, or pricing speculation, can cause large price fluctuations.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤The Stock Market Is an Auction@-1/&0/The stock market is, in essence, an auction, with one party wanting to sell its ownership in a particular company and another party wanting to buy ownership.@-1/&0/When the two parties agree on a price, the trade is matched, and that becomes the new market quotation for the stock.# Stock prices are affected by supply and demand. Because the stock market functions as an auction, when there are more buyers than there are sellers, the price has to adapt, or no trades will be made.@-1/&0/This situation tends to drive the price upward, increasing the market quotation at which investors can sell their shares.# On the other hand, when sellers outnumber buyers, and there is less demand, whoever is willing to take the lowest bid sets the price, resulting in a race to the bottom.@@@
ListPage¤What Influences Buyers and Sellers@-1/&0/On a typical day, the value of shares of stock doesn't move much. You'll usually see prices go up and down by a percentage point or two, with occasional larger swings. But sometimes, events can occur that cause shares to rise or fall sharply due to :@2&External Events (competitors earnings report, market movements, major financial news such as an interest-rate hike, natural disaster…) /Investor Analysis (earnings report, analyst report, major investment news) /Speculators (imbalance in supply and demand)@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Stock Value vs. Price@-1/&0/Res tantum valet quantum vendi potest (A thing is worth only what someone else will pay for it).@-1/&0/There is an important relationship and a fundamental difference between value and price of a financial instrument, especially stocks, and it is paramount that you understand it.# The value of a stock does move only when major changes (either in the company itself or on macro economic scale affecting the company) happen, which is not everyday.@-1/&0/Whereas the price of the stock itself changes by the second, reflecting investors’ and traders’ temporary views of the stock.@@@
TextPage¤Stock Value vs. Price@-1/&0/Value is subjective (every one has a number in mind based on his calculations or fantasies), whereas price is objective (this is what everyone can see on the screen).@-1/&0/Which one is more important has been the subject of infinite controversies for the past two centuries.# The more you invest for the long term the more time value has to materialise, otherwise you’ll always be subject to price and price only.@@@
