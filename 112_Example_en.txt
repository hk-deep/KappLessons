TextPage¤Risk vs Return@-1/&0/The “expected return” is a measure of what, on average, the yearly return for each investment will be. @-1/&0/[FORMULA 1] Expected Return = # It turns out to be 10 percent for both instruments.@-1/&0/The “variance” is a measure of the dispersion of returns. It is defined as the average squared deviation of each possible return from its expected value, which in our example is 10 percent.# [FORMULA 2] Variance = # As you can see, both investments have the same expected return but one of them has a higher variance, and is hence more volatile/uncertain/risky.@-1/&0/So now, which one will you pick?@@@
ImagePage¤Example@-1/&0/The square root of the variance is known as the standard deviation. And when annualized (i.e. multiplied by the square root of 252), it’s known as volatility. @0@-1/&0/Dispersion measures of risk such as variance and standard deviation have failed to satisfy everyone. It is true that only the possibility of downward disappointments constitutes risk. Nevertheless, as a practical matter, as long as the distribution of returns is symmetric, i.e. as long as the chances of extraordinary gain are roughly the same as the probabilities for disappointing returns and losses, as in the case for most liquid securities, especially indexes, a dispersion or variance measure will suffice as a risk measure. #The greater the dispersion or variance, the greater the possibilities for disappointment.@@@
