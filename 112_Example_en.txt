TextPage¤Risk vs Return@-1/&0/The square root of the variance is known as the standard deviation. And when annualized (i.e. multiplied by the square root of 252), it’s known as volatility.@-1/&0/Dispersion measures of risk such as variance and standard deviation have failed to satisfy everyone. It is true that only the possibility of downward disappointments constitutes risk. Nevertheless, as a practical matter, as long as the distribution of returns is symmetric, i.e. as long as the chances of extraordinary gain are roughly the same as the probabilities for disappointing returns and losses, as in the case for most liquid securities, especially indexes, a dispersion or variance measure will suffice as a risk measure. @@@
