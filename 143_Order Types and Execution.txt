ListPage¤Order Types and Execution@-1/&0/@-1/&0/A market order simply buys (or sells) shares at the prevailing market prices until the order is filled.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/A limit order specifies a certain price at which the order must be filled, although there is no guarantee that some or all of the order will trade if the limit is set too high or low.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/Stop orders, a type of market order, are triggered when a stock moves above or below a certain level; they are often used as a way to insure against larger losses or to lock in profits.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/Orders that specify execution only at market open or market close are maintained separately. These are known as the “opening order” and “closing order” respectively.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Market Orders@-1/&0/A market order is the most basic type of trade. It is an order to buy or sell immediately at the current price. @-1/&0/Typically, if you are going to buy a stock, then you will pay a price at or near the posted ask. If you are going to sell a stock, you will receive a price at or near the posted bid. @-1/&0/One important thing to remember is that the last traded price is not necessarily the price at which the market order will be executed. @-1/&0/In fast-moving and volatile markets, the price at which you actually execute (or fill) the trade can deviate from the last traded price.@@@
TextPage¤Market Orders@-1/&0/Market orders are popular among individual investors who want to buy or sell a stock without delay. @-1/&0/The advantage of using market orders is that you are guaranteed to get the trade filled; in fact, it will be executed as soon as possible. @-1/&0/Although the investor doesn't know the exact price at which the stock will be bought or sold, market orders on stocks that trade over tens of thousands of shares per day will likely be executed close to the bid/ask prices.@@@
TextPage¤Limit Orders@-1/&0/A limit order, sometimes referred to as a pending order, allows investors to buy and sell securities at a certain price in the future. @-1/&0/This type of order is used to execute a trade if the price reaches the pre-defined level; the order will not be filled if the price does not reach this level. @-1/&0/In effect, a limit order sets the maximum or minimum price at which you are willing to buy or sell.@@@
ListPage¤Limit Orders@-1/&0/@-1/&0/There are two types of limit orders:@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/A Buy Limit: an order to purchase a security at or below a specified price. Limit orders must be placed on the correct side of the market to ensure they will accomplish the task of improving the price. For a buy limit order, this means placing the order at or below the current market bid.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/A Sell Limit: an order to sell a security at or above a specified price. To ensure an improved price, the order must be placed at or above the current market ask.@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Additional Order Types@-1/&0/@-1/&0/Now that we've explained the two main orders, here's a list of some added restrictions and special instructions that many different brokerages allow on their orders:@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/- Stop-Loss Order@-1/&0/- Stop-Limit Orders@-1/&0/- All or None (AON)@-1/&0/- Immediate or Cancel (IOC)@-1/&0/- Fill or Kill (FOK)@-1/&0/- Good 'Til Canceled (GTC)@-1/&0/- Day@-1/&0/- Take Profit@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Stop-Loss Order@-1/&0/A stop-loss order is also referred to as a stopped market, on-stop buy, or on-stop sell; this is one of the most useful orders. @-1/&0/This order is different because, unlike the limit and market orders, which are active as soon as they are entered, this order remains dormant until a certain price is passed, at which time it is activated as a market order. @-1/&0/For instance, if a stop-loss sell order were placed on the XYZ shares at $45 per share, the order would be inactive until the price reached or dropped below $45. The order would then be transformed into a market order, and the shares would be sold at the best available price.@@@
TextPage¤Stop-Limit Orders@-1/&0/These are similar to stop-loss orders, but as their name states, there is a limit on the price at which they will execute. @-1/&0/There are two prices specified in a stop-limit order: the stop price, which will convert the order to a sell order, and the limit price. Instead of the order becoming a market order to sell, the sell order becomes a limit order that will only execute at the limit price or better. @-1/&0/This can mitigate a potential problem with stop-loss orders, which can be triggered during a flash crash when prices plummet but subsequently recover.@@@
TextPage¤All or None (AON)@-1/&0/This type of order is especially important for those who buy penny stocks. An all-or-none order ensures that you get either the entire quantity of stock you requested or none at all. @-1/&0/This is typically problematic when a stock is very illiquid or a limit is placed on the order. @-1/&0/For example, if you put in an order to buy 2,000 shares of XYZ but only 1,000 are being sold, an all-or-none restriction means your order will not be filled until there are at least 2,000 shares available at your preferred price. @-1/&0/If you don't place an all-or-none restriction, your 2,000 share order would be partially filled for 1,000 shares.@@@
TextPage¤Immediate or Cancel (IOC)@-1/&0/An IOC order mandates that whatever amount of an order that can be executed in the market (or at a limit) in a very short time span, often just a few seconds or less, be filled and then the rest of the order canceled. @-1/&0/If no shares are traded in that "immediate" interval, then the order is canceled completely.@@@
TextPage¤Fill or Kill (FOK)@-1/&0/This type of order combines an AON order with an IOC specification; in other words, it mandates that the entire order size be traded and in a very short time period, often a few seconds or less. @-1/&0/If neither condition is met, the order is canceled.@@@
TextPage¤Good 'Til Canceled (GTC)@-1/&0/This is a time restriction that you can place on different orders. A good-til-canceled order will remain active until you decide to cancel it. @-1/&0/Brokerages will typically limit the maximum time you can keep an order open (or active) to 90 days.@@@
TextPage¤Day@-1/&0/If you don't specify a time frame of expiry through the GTC instruction, then the order will typically be set as a day order. @-1/&0/This means that after the end of the trading day, the order will expire. @-1/&0/If it isn't transacted (filled) then you will have to re-enter it the following trading day.@@@
TextPage¤Take Profit@-1/&0/A take profit order (sometimes called a profit target) is intended to close out the trade at a profit once it has reached a certain level. @-1/&0/Execution of a take profit order closes the position. @-1/&0/This type of order is always connected to an open position of a pending order.@@@
