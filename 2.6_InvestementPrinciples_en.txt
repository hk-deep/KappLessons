ListPage¤Investment Principles@-1/&0/To establish a sound foundation for investment decisions, it's crucial to uphold certain fundamental principles. While some of these have been tacitly addressed previously, articulating them explicitly here can offer valuable clarity. The key principles are as follows:@1&Historical data consistently demonstrates a correlation between risk and return./The risk associated with investments in stocks and bonds is influenced by the duration of the investment horizon./Dollar-cost averaging presents a viable strategy for mitigating risk in both stock and bond investments./Regular rebalancing can minimize risk and, sometimes, may enhance investment returns./It's essential to differentiate between your risk tolerance and your financial capacity for risk. The level of risk you can undertake is contingent upon your overall financial circumstances.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Risk & Return are linked@-1/&0/While you might feel weary of hearing that greater investment rewards necessitate assuming more risk, this principle remains paramount in investment management. @-1/&0/Centuries of historical data substantiate this fundamental law of finance.# Common stocks, for instance, have historically yielded remarkably high long-term rates of return.@-1/&0/ It's estimated that if George Washington had invested just one dollar from his first presidential salary in common stocks, his heirs would have amassed wealth exceeding a millionfold by now.@@@
TextPage¤Risk & Return are linked@-1/&0/Stocks have delivered a compounded rate of return of over 8 percent per year since 1790. However, these returns came with significant risk. @-1/&0/While stocks have generated substantial returns, they've also exhibited considerable volatility, with negative total returns occurring approximately three out of ten years.@-1/&0/ Therefore, while pursuing higher returns, it's essential to remember the adage "There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch." Increased returns typically come hand in hand with heightened risk.@@@
TextPage¤Risk depends on length of holding@-1/&0/Risk depends on the length of holding because the longer you hold an investment, the more time there is for market fluctuations to average out. @-1/&0/Short-term holdings are subject to higher volatility and can be significantly impacted by market swings. However, over a longer period, these fluctuations tend to stabilize, potentially reducing the overall risk.@-1/&0/ Long-term investments also have more time to recover from downturns, making them generally less risky compared to short-term holdings.@@@
TextPage¤Averaging Can Reduce Risk@-1/&0/Averaging can reduce risk by spreading investments over time, which mitigates the impact of market volatility. @-1/&0/This technique, known as dollar-cost averaging, involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions.# By doing so, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, potentially lowering the average cost per share.@-1/&0/ This strategy helps smooth out the effects of market fluctuations and reduces the risk of making a large investment at an inopportune time.@@@
TextPage¤Rebalancing Can Reduce Risk@-1/&0/Rebalancing can reduce risk by maintaining your desired asset allocation, ensuring your portfolio stays aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals. @-1/&0/Over time, some investments may grow faster than others, causing your portfolio to become unbalanced and potentially riskier than intended.# By periodically selling overperforming assets and buying underperforming ones, you restore the original asset mix.@-1/&0/This process helps manage risk by preventing any single asset class from dominating your portfolio, promoting diversification and stability.# Beware however of excessive rebalancing as it may lead to high cost of transaction which can lower your return.@@@
