TextPage¤Applying the Wealth Allocation Framework@-1/&0/Using the concept of personal risk in the context of setting an asset allocation strategy is key to meet your personal goals.@-1/&0/The wealth allocation framework allows you to segment your assets and create appropriate financial strategies towards particular goals, while assuming a consistent overall approach to resource allocation.#The incorporation of alternative investments as well as real estate plays a critical role in the analysis of the optimal wealth allocation alongside the traditional MPT framework.@17/1/124@@
ImagePage¤Dynamic Characteristics of Optimal Risk Allocation@-1/&0/Your optimal risk allocation depends not just on the relative risk-return characteristics of markets, but also on how much wealth you have relative to what you need and how far away from the danger zone you are. This is a dynamic situation as you can see in the graph below. @0@-1/&0/@GRAPH@@@
TextPage¤Sample Risk Allocation for a Conservative Investor@-1/&0/If you are in the “danger zone,” you should be more conservative. You will value more highly investments that do not go down.@-1/&0/This means that the relevant risk measure will weigh more heavily the possibility or danger of negative returns, rather than the possibility of upside returns.#For example, you will look more favorably at a principal-protected mutual fund (with correspondingly limited upside) than at a conventional unhedged security.@@@
ImagePage¤Sample Risk Allocation for a Conservative Investor@-1/&0/This risk allocation will be dominated by personal risk as shown here: @0@-1/&0/@GRAPH@0@-1/&0/It is worth noting that the minimum level of wealth shown here will often vary based on your relative wealth as opposed to a hard number based on the actual amount needed to maintain a lifestyle.@@@
TextPage¤Sample Risk Allocation for Affluent Investors@-1/&0/If you have a decent cushion from the danger zone, then your allocation is similar to that of the aggregate market and the appropriate risk measure is similar or identical to the one used by the financial markets, i.e., volatility.@-1/&0/The right risk allocation for you will be to overweight assets in the market risk bucket.@@@
ImagePage¤Sample Risk Allocation for Affluent Investors@-1/&0/The benefits of being in this zone are that, since you have similar risk-return considerations as the aggregate market, you invest in liquid and (comparatively) low-transaction-cost securities such as stocks and bonds. @0@-1/&0/@GRAPH@@@
TextPage¤Sample Risk Allocation for Wealthy Investors@-1/&0/As you get wealthier, you’ll begin to look for investments that allow for further upside potential, e.g., some types of hedge funds or venture capital. @-1/&0/In this region, you’ll be willing to take greater risks, i.e., possible loss of principal. @-1/&0/Your risk measure is therefore weighted more towards the potential of upside gains than the possibility of negative returns.@@@
ImagePage¤Sample Risk Allocation for Wealthy Investors@-1/&0/@GRAPH@0@-1/&0/This risk allocation will be over-weighted by assets in the aspirational risk bucket. Finally, these ratios may be affected by other factors, such as the lifecycle stage of the investor.@@@
TextPage¤Incorporating Lifestyle Stage and Human Capital@-1/&0/Human capital turns out to be important for bringing in both lifestyle and lifecycle considerations into a wealth strategy. @-1/&0/It should be clear that doctors or engineers or executives in the early stages of their career have substantial earning potential. # @-1/&0/They have human capital that over the years should transfer to financial capital.@@@
TextPage¤Incorporating Lifestyle Stage and Human Capital@-1/&0/This investment should be considered as part of the portfolio for mitigating personal risk and allows individuals to place more investments in the market and aspirational risk buckets. @-1/&0/It may also allow them to buy a house (with a mortgage) earlier than someone without such a skill set. # @-1/&0/On the contrary, someone approaching retirement has mostly depleted his human capital and should consider investing in the aspirational bucket only if he is already affluent.@@@
