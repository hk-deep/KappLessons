TextPage¤What Are Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) ?@-1/&0/ETFs are baskets of securities with multiple assets like stocks, bonds, and gold, making them similar to mutual funds, especially index funds. @-1/&0/However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks, meaning that investors can buy and sell shares on an exchange. @-1/&0/Besides, most ETFs are passively managed which means they have cheaper expense ratios than mutual funds.@@@
TextPage¤What Are Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) ?@-1/&0/An ETF provides investors with access to hundreds of financial instruments, thus helping with diversification. @-1/&0/When you buy shares of an ETF, you buy an interest in all of its held investments. @-1/&0/The versatility of ETFs makes them valuable tools for investing either in broad market indices or in sectors.@@@
TextPage¤How ETFs Work@-1/&0/Buying and selling ETFs can be as easy as buying a stock and can be done through a brokerage account during normal trading hours. @-1/&0/When placing an ETF trade, you'll have to choose a certain number of shares to buy or sell, just like with a stock. @-1/&0/For example, if you want to buy $1,000 of a particular ETF and it trades at $100 per share, you'll need to place a buy order for 10 shares, using the ETF's ticker symbol.@@@
TextPage¤Creation & Redemption of ETFs@-1/&0/While ETFs trade on an exchange like stocks, they have a unique process of share creation and redemption. @-1/&0/A third party, known as authorized participants (APs), handles the buying and selling of the ETF's underlying securities, generally in large chunks of shares known as creation units. @-1/&0/That way, the ETF doesn't absorb those trading costs, and the price of the fund stays closely tied to that of the underlying index, regardless of supply and demand.@@@
ListPage¤ETFs Pros@-1/&0/ETFs can be smart investment tools for all types of investors. However, they might not be ideal for everyone. Before investing in ETFs, it’s wise to know the pros and cons.@2&Diversification: Investors can gain access to dozens, or even hundreds, of stocks or bonds in one ETF. Holding multiple investment securities in one fund reduces volatility, compared to buying just one or a few individual securities./Low cost: Most ETFs are passively managed, so there is no need for costly research or analysis, which reduces management costs. ETFs' expense ratios, on average, are significantly lower than those of mutual funds. Many ETFs have expenses below 0.25%. By contrast, the expense ratio for the average mutual fund is about 0.75%.@@@
ListPage¤ETFs Pros@-1/&0/@2&Tax efficiency: Actively managed mutual funds trade their holdings, which creates capital gains distribution that is often taxable to the shareholder. While ETF gains are also taxable, their structure generally makes them more tax-efficient than mutual funds./Market orders: Since ETFs trade throughout the day on exchanges, an investor can place market orders, such as stop-loss orders and limit orders.@@@
ListPage¤ETFs Cons@-1/&0/@2&Trading costs can add up: ETFs sometimes generate a small trading commission every time an investor buys or sells shares. Although the commission fees are low, they add up quickly if you’re making frequent trades./May be too narrowly focused: Many ETFs track a particular sector benchmark or similar niche area of the market, such as technology. Those types of ETFs tend to have wider swings in price than a broader market index, such as the S&P 500./Temptation to trade: The ability to buy and sell quickly can make it tempting to dabble in market-timing, which can be more harmful than good. It causes people to speculate on price changes instead of investing for the longer term.@@@
