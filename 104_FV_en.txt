TextPage¤Future Value@-1/&0/Now say you have a sum of money that you want to invest. How much can you expect to have in a few years? Future Value is the answer to your question.@-1/&0/The concept of future value (FV) is about understanding how much a sum of money today will be worth at a specific point in the future, given a certain interest rate.# FV is vital for understanding the growth potential of investments and assessing the impact of time on the value of money. It is calculated by compounding the initial amount over a specific time period.@@@
TextPage¤Explanation@-1/&0/Imagine you have some money right now, and you want to know how much it will grow over time if you invest it.@-1/&0/The future value is the amount of money you'll have in the future, considering the interest or returns you earn on your investment.# Think of future value as figuring out how much your money will grow over time if you leave it in a bank account that earns interest.@@@
ListPage¤Example@-1/&0/Let’s say you have $100 now, and you want to find out how much it will be worth in 3 years if you invest it at an annual interest rate of 5%.@2&1. Current Value (CV): $100/2. Interest Rate (r): 5% or 0.05/3. Number of Periods (n): 3 years@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Example@-1/&0/Let's calculate it step by step:@-1/&0/After 1 year the value is $100 * (1 + 5%) = $105, i.e., you get back your investment plus 5%# After 2 years, assuming you reinvest $105, the value is $105 * (1 + 5%) = $110.25@-1/&0/After 3 years, the value is $110.25 * (1 + 5%) = $115.76.@@@
TextPage¤Example@-1/&0/So, after 3 years, your $100 will grow to approximately $115.76.@-1/&0/This is the future value of your money given the interest rate and time period.# The calculation would be: FV = $100 × (1 + 0.05)^3 = $115.76.@@@
ListPage¤Formula@-1/&0/The basic formula to calculate future value (FV) is:@2&FV=CPV/(1+r)^n@-1/&0/Where:@2&FV= Future Value/CV = Current Value (the money you have now)/r = Interest rate per period (expressed as a decimal)/n = Number of periods (years)@@@
