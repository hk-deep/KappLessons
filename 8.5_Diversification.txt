TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/OK, so now that you have allocated your portfolio across the main asset classes you’d think you’re done… @-1/&0/Well not yet. You need to go one step further and insure your portfolio is properly diversified. What does that mean? @-1/&0/You can allocate your money across several types of assets without properly diversifying those investments.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/For example, if the stocks in your portfolio are all securities in just a few large-cap companies, you're not necessarily diversified for better growth. @-1/&0/Diversifying your portfolio means covering a lot of different risk and return levels with your various investments. @-1/&0/Allocation is one way to do that, but you should always go a step further to diversify within each asset class.@@@
TextPage¤What Is Diversification?@-1/&0/Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct investment vehicles in an attempt to limit exposure to any single instrument or risk. @-1/&0/The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different securities will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security. @-1/&0/You can diversify on your own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds.@@@
TextPage¤Understanding Diversification@-1/&0/Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 20 to 30 securities yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. This means that you should not hold more than 5% of a single stock or bond in your portfolio. @-1/&0/Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness. @-1/&0/The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.@@@
ImagePage¤Diversification Example@-1/&0/What this means is that once you’ve decided how much of your portfolio you allocate to each asset class (cash, bonds, equities etc…), you need for each of these categories to invest your money in different instruments in order to avoid concentration of risk on say 1 stock or 1 bond.@0@-1/&0/In this example allocation is deciding to invest 50% of your portfolio in equities, 40% in bonds, and the rest in cash. Diversification refers to splitting your equity allocation into 5 instruments (2 ETFs, 1 Mutual Fund, and 2 single stocks) an so on for your bond and cash allocations.@@@
ImagePage¤Types of Risk@-1/&0/The idea behind diversification is to minimize (or even eliminate) risk within a portfolio. However, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and certain types of risks exist regardless of how you diversify. These types of risks are called systematic and non-systematic risks. @1@-1/&0/In general, diversification aims to reduce non-systematic risk. These are the risks specific to an investment that are unique to that holding.@@@
ImagePage¤Types of Risk@-1/&0/Examples of diversifiable, non-systematic risks include:@2@-1/&0/Through diversification, investors strive to reduce the risks above, which are controllable based on the investments held.@@@
