TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/OK, so now that you have allocated your portfolio across the main asset classes you’d think you’re done… @-1/&0/Well not yet. You need to go one step further and insure your portfolio is properly diversified. @-1/&0/What does that mean? You can allocate your money across several types of assets without properly diversifying those investments.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/For example, if the stocks in your portfolio are all securities in just a few large-cap companies, you're not necessarily diversified for better growth. @-1/&0/Diversifying your portfolio means covering a lot of different risk and return levels with your various investments. @-1/&0/Allocation is one way to do that, but you should always go a step further to diversify within each asset class.@@@
TextPage¤What Is Diversification?@-1/&0/Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct investment vehicles in an attempt to limit exposure to any single instrument or risk. @-1/&0/The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security. @-1/&0/The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of securities. #You can diversify on your own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds.@@@
TextPage¤Understanding Diversification@-1/&0/Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 20 to 30 securities yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. @-1/&0/This means that you should not hold more than 5% of a single stock or bond in your portfolio. @-1/&0/Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness. #The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.@@@
TextPage¤Types of Risk@-1/&0/The idea behind diversification is to minimize (or even eliminate) risk within a portfolio. However, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and certain types of risks exist regardless of how you diversify. @-1/&0/These types of risks are called systematic and non-systematic risks. @-1/&0/In general, diversification aims to reduce non-systematic risk. These are the risks specific to an investment that are unique to that holding.@@@
ListPage¤Types of Risk@-1/&0/Examples of diversifiable, non-systematic risks include:@1&Business risk: The risk related to a specific company based on the nature of its company and what it does in the market./Financial risk: The risks related to a specific company or organization's financial health, liquidity, and long-term solvency./Operational risk: The risk related to breakdowns in manufacturing or goods distribution processes./Regulatory risk: The risk that legislation may adversely impact the asset.@-1/&0/Through diversification, investors strive to reduce the risks above, which are controllable based on the investments held.@@@

TextPage¤Diversification for You@-1/&0/Time and budget constraints can make it difficult for individuals to create an adequately diversified portfolio. This challenge is a key to why mutual funds are so popular with retail investors. @-1/&0/Buying shares in a mutual fund or an ETF offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments. @-1/&0/There are several reasons why this is advantageous to investors. First, it may be costly for individual investors to buy securities using different market orders. In addition, investors must then track their portfolio's weight to ensure proper diversification. #Though you sacrifice a say in all of the underlying companies being invested in, you choose an easier investment approach that prioritizes minimizing risk.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification Across Platforms@-1/&0/Regardless of how you consider building your portfolio, another aspect of diversification relates to how your assets are held. @-1/&0/Though this is not an implication of the investment's risk, it is an additional risk worth considering as it may be diversifiable. @-1/&0/You should consider opening numerous accounts at various financial institutions to protect yourself from the risk of one of them going belly up.@@@
