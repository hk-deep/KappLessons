ImagePage¤What Is a Bond ?@-1/&0/Simply put, a bond is a loan. When you purchase a bond, you provide a loan to the issuer. A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.@1@-1/&0/Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.@@@
