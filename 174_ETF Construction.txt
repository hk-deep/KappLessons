TextPage¤Who Creates ETFs?@-1/&0/ETF managers are also known as sponsors. They are responsible for designing, developing, and, in most cases, managing the ETF. @-1/&0/Once the sponsor knows the type of security they want to create, they file a plan with the relevant market authority to create the ETF.# At times, the ETF provider will utilize the skills of other financial entities by partnering with them to manage a new fund. @-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤How Are The Funds Assembled ?@-1/&0/The first step in the creation process is for an ETF sponsor or provider to decide which sector, commodity, or market to track.

TextPage¤What Should You Look For in an ETF?@-1/&0/The first aspect to analyze when considering a new ETF is to look at the holdings. There's a lot you can learn about an ETF just by looking at the assets it holds.@-1/&0/Some ETFs can be a bit complex to examine.
