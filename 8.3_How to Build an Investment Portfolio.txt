TextPage¤How to Build an Investment Portfolio@-1/&0/Building a portfolio is similar to building a house: There are many different kinds of strategies, designs, tools, and building materials; but each structure shares some basic features. @-1/&0/One of these building blocks are funds (either mutual funds or ETFs).# The first thing to do is to decide the allocation between Fixed Income (bonds and money market) and Equities (stocks).@@@
ListPage¤How to Build an Investment Portfolio@-1/&0/A structure that can stand the test of time requires a smart design, a strong foundation, and a simple combination of mutual funds that work well for your needs :@1&Combining different types of mutual funds creates a balanced portfolio./One core fund can serve as the foundation, with funds in various categories making up the rest./Knowing your tolerance for risk will have an effect on which funds you choose./Keeping a long-term outlook is always a sound policy.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Know Your Risk Tolerance@-1/&0/Before choosing your funds, you need to have a good idea of how much loss you can sustain. @-1/&0/Your risk tolerance is a measure of how much fluctuation (a.k.a. volatility—ups and downs) or market risk you can handle.# For example, if you get highly anxious when your $10,000 account value falls by 10% (to $9,000) in a one-year period, your risk tolerance is relatively low—you can’t tolerate high-risk investments.@@@
TextPage¤Determine Your Asset Allocation@-1/&0/Once you determine your level of risk tolerance, you can determine your asset allocation, which is the mix of investment assets—stocks, bonds, and cash—that comprises your portfolio. @-1/&0/The proper asset allocation will reflect your level of risk tolerance, which can be described as either aggressive (high tolerance for risk), moderate (medium risk tolerance), or conservative (low-risk tolerance).# The higher your risk tolerance, the more stocks you will have in relation to bonds and cash in your portfolio; and the lower your risk tolerance, the lower your percentage of stocks in relation to bonds and cash.@@@
TextPage¤Use a Core/Satellite Portfolio Design@-1/&0/Before building begins, you will need a basic design—a blueprint—to follow. A common and time-tested portfolio design is called Core and Satellite. @-1/&0/This structure is just as it sounds: You begin with the "core"—a large-cap stock fund—which represents the largest portion of your portfolio and builds around the core with the "satellite" funds, which will each represent smaller portions of your portfolio.@@@
ListPage¤Use Different Types of Fund Categories for the Structure@-1/&0/With a large-cap stock fund as your core, different types of funds—the "satellites"—will complete the structure of your fund portfolio. These other funds can include :@2&Sector funds/Mid-cap stock/Small-cap stock/Foreign stock/Fixed income (bond)/Money market funds@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Learn How to Choose the Best Funds@-1/&0/Now that you know your asset allocation, all that remains is choosing the best funds for you. @-1/&0/If you have a broad choice of funds (mutual or ETFs) begin by using a fund screener, or you may compare performance to a benchmark.# You’ll also want to consider important characteristics of funds, such as fund fees and expenses and manager tenure, and whether you want to go for active (managed) or passive (index) funds.@@@
