TextPage¤How Exchanges Work@-1/&0/Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations, all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another. @-1/&0/This is often done through an auction or price-discovery mechanism. @-1/&0/When most people think of a stock exchange, they envision the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shouting brokers negotiating buys and sells via hand signals.@@@
TextPage¤How Exchanges Work@-1/&0/On a physical exchange like the NYSE, "market makers" who specialize in a particular stock will buy and sell that stock to brokers. @-1/&0/The trading floor functions like an auction house, with bid and offer prices changing throughout the trading day. @-1/&0/But most exchanges have changed over to electronic trading platforms. Electronic exchanges work in a similar way, except that it's computers that connect buyers and sellers.@@@
ImagePage¤Different types of stock exchanges@-1/&0/There are various ways to run a stock exchange, and the following three are the most common:@0@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Different types of stock exchanges@-1/&0/@1&Auction: Like any auction, the price of an item (in this case a security) is what the market will command. The highest price a bidder is willing to pay is a bid, and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept is the offer. The auction market is also called the open outcry system, and it operates just as it sounds—with brokers and traders on a physical trading floor communicating by calling out or with signals. Most have phased this system out in favor of electronic trades, but the New York Stock Exchange famously still operates this way./Dealer : Dealers post the prices they’re willing to buy or sell specific stocks, and then use their own funds to buy and sell securities. This lends liquidity to the market because a seller doesn’t need to wait for a buyer to free up their cash to buy other securities./Electronic : Electronic exchanges operate via a virtual trading floor using automated electronic communication networks (ECNs). Nearly all the exchanges now use this kind of electronic trading, even when they still have physical trading floors.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Market participants@-1/&0/The financial markets consist of various participants including governments and central banks, major global banks, hedge funds and retail traders, each of which has a different motive for trading. These motives can range from speculation on the markets to hedging business risk. @-1/&0/For example, the corporate treasurer at a global company might be hedging currency exposure on foreign transactions, like the acquisition of equipment or a sale to an overseas customer. @-1/&0/A central bank, meanwhile, may be purchasing a currency to top up its reserves.@@@
TextPage¤Buy side vs Sell side@-1/&0/Professional market participants are typically split into the ‘buy side’ and ‘sell side’. @-1/&0/The buy side is made up of hedge funds and pension funds. Their goal is to make a return for their investors and partners by investing funds in the market. The sell side is dominated by the major global banks, whose job is to facilitate the trading of investors. @-1/&0/Retail investors are typically non-professionals who are trading with their own capital in order to make a return on their investment. They gain access to the market through online brokers and may trade full-time or part-time to supplement their main income.@@@
