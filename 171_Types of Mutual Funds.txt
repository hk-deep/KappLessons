ListPage¤Types of Mutual Funds@-1/&0/There are thousands of mutual funds around the world, and they all come with various tastes and flavors.@-1/&0/To help navigate the maze MF are classified according to four main criteria.@2&Underlying assets/Market Capitalisation/Management type/Investment style@@@
ListPage¤Underlying Assets@-1/&0/Most of the many types of mutual funds you’ll find buy assets that fall in one of the four following categories :@2&Stocks/Bonds/Money markets/A mix of the above@@@
TextPage¤Underlying Assets@-1/&0/Stock funds: As the name implies, these funds invest principally in equities. Within this group are assorted subcategories. @-1/&0/Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: firms with small-, mid-, or large-sized capitalization.# Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value.# Equity funds are also categorized by their geographies.@@@
TextPage¤Underlying Assets@-1/&0/Bond funds are mutual funds that generate a consistent and minimum return and are part of the fixed-income category. @-1/&0/These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments.# The bonds should generate interest income that's passed on to the shareholders. @-1/&0/Bond funds also have style classifications, which have two primary divisions: 1) Maturity/duration, which is expressed as long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term, 2) Credit quality, which is divided into high, investment grade, and low (or junk).@@@
TextPage¤Underlying Assets@-1/&0/The money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. @-1/&0/The returns on them aren't substantial. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit (CD).# Money market mutual funds are often used as a temporary holding place for cash that will be used for future investments or for an emergency fund.@@@
TextPage¤Underlying Assets@-1/&0/Balanced funds are mutual funds that provide a combination (or balance) of underlying investment assets, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. @-1/&0/Also called "hybrid funds" or "asset allocation funds," the asset allocation remains relatively fixed and serves a stated purpose or investment style. # For example, a conservative balanced fund might invest in a conservative mix of underlying investment assets, such as 40% stocks, 50% bonds, and 10% money market.@@@
TextPage¤Market Capitalization@-1/&0/With investment securities, market capitalization (or "market cap") refers to the price of a share of stock multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. @-1/&0/Many equity mutual funds are categorized based on the average market capitalization of the stocks that the mutual funds own. This is important because investors need to be sure of what they are buying. # Large-cap stock funds invest in stocks of corporations with large market capitalizations, typically higher than $10 billion. These companies are so large that you have probably heard of them, or you may even purchase goods or services from them on a regular basis.@@@
TextPage¤Market Capitalization@-1/&0/Mid-cap stock funds invest in stocks of corporations of mid-size capitalizations, typically between $2 billion and $10 billion. @-1/&0/Small-cap stock funds invest in stocks of corporations of small-size capitalizations, typically between $500 million and $2 billion. While a billion-dollar corporation may seem large to you, it's relatively small compared to the Wal-Marts and Exxons Mobils of the world. # One subset of small-cap stocks is "Micro-cap," which represents mutual funds investing in corporations with average market capitalizations, usually less than $750 million.@@@
TextPage¤Management Type@-1/&0/All mutual funds are either actively managed or passive. @-1/&0/Actively managed funds have a manager who decides which security to buy and sell. They have a goal that guides the manager's investment decision. @-1/&0/The manager seeks to outperform their index by selecting hand-picked investments by professional money managers. As a result, their fees are higher due to the added expenses to pay for these investment managers. # Index funds match an index. Since they don't need much trading, their costs are lower. As a result, these funds have become more popular since the Great Recession.@@@
TextPage¤Mutual Fund Style@-1/&0/In addition to capitalization, stocks, and stock funds are categorized by style, divided into growth, value, or blend objectives. @-1/&0/Growth stock funds invest in growth stocks, which are stocks of companies that are expected to grow at a rate faster than the market average. @-1/&0/Value stock funds invest in value stocks, which are stocks of companies that an investor or mutual fund manager believes to be selling at a price lower than the market value. # Blend stock funds invest in a blend of growth and value stocks.@@@
TextPage¤Mutual Fund Style@-1/&0/Target Date Retirement Funds work like the name suggests. @-1/&0/Each fund has a year in the name of the fund, which would be a fund best suited for someone who expects to retire in or around the given year. @-1/&0/The fund manager assigns a suitable asset allocation (mix of stocks, bonds, and cash) and then slowly shifts the holdings to a more conservative allocation (fewer stocks, more bonds, and more cash) as the target date draws closer.@@@
TextPage¤Mutual Fund Style@-1/&0/Sector Funds focus on a specific industry, social objective, or sector such as healthcare, real estate, or technology. @-1/&0/Their investment objective is to provide concentrated exposure to specific industry groups, called "sectors." Mutual fund investors use sector funds to increase exposure to certain industry sectors that they believe will perform better than other sectors. @-1/&0/By comparison, diversified mutual funds (those that do not focus on one sector) will already have exposure to most industry sectors.@@@
