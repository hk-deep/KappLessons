ListPage¤Allocation Framework@-1/&0/To consider a more comprehensive wealth strategy we will expand the definition of portfolio to cover all assets and liabilities such as investments, home, mortgage, and human capital. (Human capital can be loosely defined as earning potential.)#The objectives of your portfolio hence fall in one of the following three categories:@1&Protection from anxiety or poverty: We will refer to this as protection from personal risk./Ability to maintain your standard of living and status in society, i.e., keep up with family and friends. In order to do this, you must take on market risk./Opportunity to increase your wealth substantially. This involves taking on some aspirational risk.@@@
ListPage¤Decision Making@-1/&0/Another way of saying it is that there are three important factors that dominate decision making in the face of risk and return trade-offs, not just in finance, but across a wide variety of human decision making: certainty, probability, and possibility.#You must construct a portfolio that provides:@1&The certainty of protection from anxiety./The high probability of maintaining one’s standing./The possibility of substantially moving upwards in the wealth spectrum.@@@
ListPage¤Three Dimensions of Risk@-1/&0/MPT only recognizes market risk and seeks to minimize it through optimal asset allocation. In contrast, the wealth allocation framework identifies three very different risk dimensions and seeks to optimize all three of them simultaneously:@1&Personal Risk: You must protect yourself from personal risk. This means protecting yourself from anxiety regarding a dramatic decrease in your lifestyle./Market Risk: You need to take on market risk in order to grow with your wealth segment and maintain your lifestyle./Aspirational Risk: You could take on aspirational risk if you desire to break away from your wealth segment and enhance your lifestyle.@@@
ImagePage¤Dress accordingly@-1/&0/With that in mind, your portfolio of assets (including cash) should reflect these 3 dimensions of risk by incorporating 3 portfolios each of which addresses a different risk appetite: @1@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Wrap up@-1/&0/In summary, investors have different investing preferences based on their needs, fears, and aspirations:@2&Allocations to the personal risk bucket will limit loss of wealth, but will yield below-market returns./Allocations to the market risk bucket will provide risk-adjusted market returns (this is the MPT framework)./Allocations to the aspirational risk bucket should yield higher-than-market returns, but with the risk of substantial loss of capital.@@@
