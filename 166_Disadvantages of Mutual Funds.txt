ListPage¤Disadvantages of Mutual Funds@-1/&0/Before you invest in mutual funds, you should do your homework. Let’s take a look at several potential disadvantages of mutual funds:@2&“Hidden fees” must be revealed in the mutual fund prospectus; however, not every mutual fund charges these fees./Investors who like the flexibility of ETFs may balk at waiting until the close of market for mutual fund order transactions./There are strategies to avoid the capital gains distributions, including tax-loss harvesting and selling a mutual fund prior to the distribution.@@@
TextPage¤Hidden Fees@-1/&0/If fees were hidden, those hidden fees would certainly be on the list of disadvantages of mutual funds. @-1/&0/Sometimes fund managers charge an annual marketing or distribution fee on mutual funds (also known as the 12b-1 fee). @-1/&0/This is considered to be an operational expense and, as such, is included in a fund's expense ratio. It is generally between 0.25% and 0.75% (the maximum allowed) of a fund's net assets and must be disclosed on the fund's prospectus. @-1/&0/The fee is disclosed in the mutual fund prospectus and can be found on the mutual funds’ websites. @-1/&0/Many mutual funds do not charge this fee.@@@
TextPage¤Lack of Liquidity@-1/&0/How quickly can you get your money if you sell a mutual fund, compared to ETFs, stocks, and closed-end funds? @-1/&0/If you sell a mutual fund, you typically have access to your cash the day after the sale. @-1/&0/ETFs, stocks, and closed-end funds require you to wait two days after you sell the investment. The “lack of liquidity” disadvantage of mutual funds is a myth.@@@
TextPage¤High Sales Charges@-1/&0/Should a sales charge be included in the list of disadvantages of mutual funds? @-1/&0/It’s difficult to justify paying a sales charge when you have a plethora of no-load mutual funds. But then again, it’s difficult to say that a sales charge is a disadvantage of mutual funds when you have thousands of mutual fund options that do not have sales charges. @-1/&0/Sales charges are too broad to be included on the list of disadvantages of mutual funds.@@@
TextPage¤Poor Trade Execution@-1/&0/If you buy or sell a mutual fund, the transaction will take place at the close of the market, regardless of the time you entered the order to buy or sell the mutual fund. @-1/&0/The trading of mutual funds can be a simple, stress-free feature of the investment structure. @-1/&0/However, many advocates and purveyors of ETFs will point out that you can trade throughout the day with ETFs. @-1/&0/If you decide to invest in ETFs over mutual funds because your order can be filled immediately with ETFs, and know exactly at what price you trade, rather than at end of day with mutual funds and waiting a day for execution price.@@@
TextPage¤High Capital Gains Distributions@-1/&0/If all mutual funds sell holdings and pass the capital gains on to investors as a taxable event, then we have found a winner for the list of disadvantages of the mutual funds, but not all mutual funds make annual capital gains distributions. @-1/&0/Index mutual funds and tax-efficient mutual funds do not make these distributions every year. Yes, if they have the gains, they must distribute the gains to shareholders. @-1/&0/In addition, retirement plans are not impacted by capital gains distributions. @-1/&0/There are also strategies to avoid capital gains distributions, including tax-loss harvesting and selling a mutual fund prior to a distribution.@@@
