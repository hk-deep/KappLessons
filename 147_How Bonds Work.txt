TextPage¤How Bonds Work@-1/&0/Bonds are commonly referred to as fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes that individual investors are usually familiar with, along with stocks (equities) and cash equivalents.@-1/&0/When companies or other entities need to raise money to finance new projects, maintain ongoing operations, or refinance existing debts, they may issue bonds directly to investors.# The borrower (issuer) issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the time at which the loaned funds (bond principal) must be paid back (maturity date).@@@

TextPage¤Bond Life@-1/&0/Most bonds can be sold by the initial bondholder to other investors after they have been issued.@-1/&0/In other words, a bond investor does not have to hold a bond all the way through to its maturity date.# It is also common for bonds to be repurchased by the borrower if interest rates decline, or if the borrower’s credit has improved, and it can reissue new bonds at a lower cost.@@@
