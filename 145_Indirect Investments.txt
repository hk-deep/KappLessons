TextPage¤Indirect Investments@-1/&0/Indirect investments are investment vehicles that hold direct investments selected by professional portfolio managers.# Investors pay the portfolio managers a management fee to choose and monitor direct investments.@-1/&0/Direct and indirect investments can also be categorized by whether they are public or private.@@@
TextPage¤Pooled Investment Vehicles@-1/&0/Pooled investment vehicles are the most common type of indirect investments.# Examples of pooled investment vehicles are open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). @-1/&0/Pooled investment vehicles are created and led by sponsors, such as asset managers. The sponsor hires or retains a portfolio management team to select direct investments to be held in the pooled vehicles.# Shareholders of the pooled investment vehicle own the vehicle itself, rather than the underlying direct investments controlled by the vehicle.@@@
TextPage¤Public Investment Vehicles@-1/&0/Public investment vehicles are available for purchase by the general public.# Most public investment vehicles are purchased using a brokerage firm that acts as a middleman to facilitate the trade. @-1/&0/Some public investment vehicles, such as ETFs and closed-end funds, trade on an exchange.# The exchange matches buyers with sellers.@-1/&0/Other public investment vehicles, such as open mutual funds, are bought directly from the sponsor, although a brokerage firm may assist with the purchase.@@@
TextPage¤Mutual Funds@-1/&0/A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that requires the participation of multiple investors.# Essentially, money managers who operate mutual funds sell shares in the fund to a pool of investors. @-1/&0/These investment dollars are then used to invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other investment vehicles on behalf of the participants in the pool.# Throughout the entire process, the money manager handles the allocation of funds.@-1/&0/This gives individual investors with a relatively small amount of investing capital the ability to have their money professionally managed in a portfolio of equities, bonds, and other securities.@-1/&0/As all shareholders combine their funds to purchase these financial instruments, all shareholders involved in the mutual fund participate proportionally in the gains or losses that are experienced.@@@
TextPage¤ETFs@-1/&0/Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) work just like mutual funds.# A large pool of investor dollars are put together to purchase assets with the goal of creating gains.@-1/&0/Also, as with mutual funds, participants proportionally share in gains and losses generated by the ETF.# The key difference between an ETF and a mutual fund is that shares of ETFs are publicly traded on the open market.@-1/&0/That means they can be found on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and can be bought and sold just like an individual stock.@-1/&0/Although most ETFs are index-based, there are ETFs centered around industries, unique strategies, and more.@@@
TextPage¤Private Investment Vehicles@-1/&0/Private investment vehicles are not available to the general public.@-1/&0/Often investors in private investment vehicles must meet certain income or net worth thresholds to participate in the investment offering.# In the U.S., there are different levels of qualification to be able to invest in a private investment vehicle, such as being an accredited investor or a qualified purchaser.@-1/&0/Examples of private investment vehicles include hedge funds, private real estate investment trusts, and venture capital limited partnerships.# Many private investment vehicles are considered alternative investments because they invest outside of traditional public stock and debt markets.@@@
