TextPage¤Stock Market Indexes@-1/&0/A stock index is a basket of stocks that all fit a certain theme. These stocks are bundled together to replicate an economy, market, or sector.@-1/&0/This allows investors to broadly track securities as easily as they could track a single stock.@-1/&0/When the index slumps, it means the stocks within the index are—on average—slumping. Some stocks in the index may be up when the index is down, but overall, there is more downward momentum among stocks tracked by the index.@-1/&0/A stock market index is created to closely track the performance of any particular aspect of the market, whether it's the 500 largest U.S. companies or the rate of inflation. They are tools that economists, investors, and others can use to monitor market performance in different ways.@@@
ListPage¤How an Index Works@-1/&0/A theoretical example might help to illustrate this. Suppose we created an index to track the price of a gallon of milk.@2&When we start tracking, let's say milk costs $2.00 a gallon./The starting index value is 1./When milk goes to $2.50, our index goes to 1.25, which reflects a 25% increase in the price of milk./If milk then goes to $2.25, the index goes to 1.15. The .10 change reflects a 10% decrease in the price of milk.@-1/&0/If you were a milk dealer, you might find a milk index useful. Instead of going to the store each day to write down the prices of each competitor's milk and averaging them together, the index would provide that data for you.@-1/&0/Stock market indexes are used by traders, economists, and academics. Each uses the information in a different way.@@@
ListPage¤Types of Indexes@-1/&0/While an index may contain hundreds of stocks, they aren't all included equally. Index-weighting refers to the method of how the shares in an index basket are allocated. In other words, an index's weighting is how the index is designed.@2&Price-weighted indexes: Each stock's proportional share in the index is based on its share price./Value-weighted indexes: Each stock's proportional share is based on its total market capitalization (share price times outstanding shares). This is also known as a market-capitalization-weighted index./Unweighted indexes: Each stock has an equal value within the index as a whole.@-1/&0/The weighting of an index has a significant impact on how it will perform. In a weighted index, the stocks with more weight will have a bigger impact on the index's movement overall. In an unweighted index, no single stock holds greater sway.@@@
ListPage¤Main Stock Indices@-1/&0/In the financial world, indexes are created to track items such as publicly traded stocks, bonds, and consumer prices for common goods and services. Most common stock indices include:@2&S&P 500: Tracks the performance of stocks of 500 of the largest companies across various industries in the U.S./MSCI EAFE (Europe, Asia, Far East): Measures the performance of stocks in developed countries outside of the U.S. and Canada./Dow Jones Industrial Average: Tracks the performance of 30 companies from different industries representing the largest and most widely held publicly traded companies in the U.S./Nasdaq 100: Tracks the 100 largest tech companies in the US/EuroStoxx 50: Tracks the performance of the 50 biggest companies in Eurozone.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤How You Can Use an Index in Investing@-1/&0/Sometimes it's hard to know how well your portfolio or financial advisor is performing. You might hear numbers like 3%, 5%, or 10% growth but what does that really mean? Are those good numbers? The answer is, it depends.@-1/&0/You should measure the performance of your portfolio or financial advisor against an index. Aside from simply investing directly in an S&P 500 index fund, you could compare your entire stock portfolio to the S&P 500.@-1/&0/If your portfolio outperforms the index, congratulations. But if your portfolio consistently underperforms the index by a large margin, that's a good reason to ask some questions.@@@
TextPage¤Alternatives to Replicating Indexes in Your Portfolio@-1/&0/While you can individually buy all the stocks in an index, there's an easier way to add index exposure. Some Mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) track indexes.@-1/&0/These products essentially lower the barriers to entry to buying these indexes. Rather than saving up the money needed to buy one share of every stock listed on an index, an investor can obtain the same diversification by buying a single share in a mutual fund or ETF that tracks that index.@-1/&0/Fees are the primary drawback to mutual funds and ETFs. A fund manager ensures that the underlying stocks replicate the index being tracked, so investors pay fees to compensate the manager.@@@
