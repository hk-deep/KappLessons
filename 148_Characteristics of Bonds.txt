ListPage¤Characteristics of Bonds@-1/&0/Most bonds share some common basic characteristics including:@1&Face value (par value) is the reference amount for all other characteristics expressed in percentage terms./Redemption value is the money amount the bond will be worth at maturity./The coupon rate is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage./Coupon dates are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Payments can be made in any interval, but the standard is semiannual payments./The maturity date is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond./The issue price is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In most cases, bonds are issued at par.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Face Value@-1/&0/The face value, or par value, is the money amount the bond will be worth at maturity; it is also the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments. @-1/&0/Say you purchase a bond at a price of 109% (or 9% premium), what does that mean in real dollars? How much do you pay? Well, if the face value of the bond is 1,000$, then the price you pay is 1,090$. @-1/&0/Bonds usually trade in % of their face value, so it’s the first thing you need to check when you want to buy some.@@@
TextPage¤Redemption Value@-1/&0/Redemption value is the price at which the bond issuer redeems the bond at maturity date, usually expressed as a percentage of face value. @-1/&0/A bond is purchased "at a discount" if its redemption value exceeds its purchase price. It is purchased "at a premium" if its purchase price exceeds its redemption value. @-1/&0/In the previous example, say you buy a bond at 109%, and another investor buys it later at 98%. You will be both redeemed the same amount, usually 100% of face value (at par).@@@
TextPage¤Coupon Rate@-1/&0/The coupon rate is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage. @-1/&0/For example, a 5% coupon rate means that bondholders will receive 5% x $1,000 (in our case face value) = $50 every year until maturity. @-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Coupon Dates@-1/&0/Coupon dates are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. @-1/&0/Payments can be made in any interval, but the standard is semiannual payments. @-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Maturity Date@-1/&0/Maturity is the date when the principal or par amount of the bond is paid to investors and the issuer’s bond obligation ends. Therefore, it defines the lifetime of the bond. A bond’s maturity is one of the primary considerations that an investor weighs against their investment goals and horizon. Maturity is often classified in three ways:@1&Short-term: Bonds that fall into this category tend to mature in one to three years./Medium-term: Maturity dates for these types of bonds are normally four to 10 years./Long-term: These bonds generally mature over more than 10 years.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Issue Price@-1/&0/The issue price is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. @-1/&0/In many cases, bonds are issued at par (100%) but they can sometimes be issued at a discount. @-1/&0/@@@
