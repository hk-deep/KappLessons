ListPage¤Increasing risk@-1/&0/As you should know by now, risk has its rewards. So everyone tries to exploit risk to earn greater returns. Hence some new theories and tools emerged that refine Modern Portfolio Theory :@1&Market Beta/Capital-Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)/Arbitrage Pricing Theory/Three-Factor Model@-1/&0/You don’t need to know about all these, but if you've gotten here, congrats to you for being curious.#Let's dive in@@@
TextPage¤Beta and Systematic Risk@-1/&0/Beta and systematic risk are closely related concepts in finance, both of which are used to assess the risk associated with an investment. @-1/&0/Systematic Risk, or market risk or non-diversifiable risk, refers to the risk inherent in the overall market or economy that cannot be eliminated through diversification. It affects the entire market and is beyond the control of individual investors. # Beta is a measure of the risk of a security or portfolio in relation to the overall market. It quantifies the sensitivity of an asset's returns to movements in the broader market. @-1/&0/In short, the closer the Beta is to 1, the lower the diversification effect on your portfolio.@@@
TextPage¤The Capital-Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)@-1/&0/The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model used to determine the expected return on an investment based on its risk level. @-1/&0/It suggests that the expected return of an investment is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium, which is determined by the investment's beta (systematic risk) multiplied by the market risk premium.@@@
ListPage¤CAPM Formula@-1/&0/The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula is: *E*(*Ri*)=*Rf*+*βi*×(*E*(*Rm*)−*Rf*)@1&*E*(*Ri*) is the expected return on the investment/*Rf* is the risk-free rate of return/*βi* is the beta of the investment, representing its systematic risk/*E*(*Rm*) is the expected return on the market/*E*(*Rm*)−*Rf* is the market risk premium, representing the excess return expected from investing in the market over the risk-free rate@-1/&0/The CAPM helps investors assess the expected return of an investment relative to its risk and compare it to other investment opportunities. It is widely used in finance for estimating the required rate of return for securities and evaluating investment decisions.@@@
TextPage¤Arbitrage Pricing Theory@-1/&0/Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a financial model used to determine the expected return of an asset based on various factors that influence its price. @-1/&0/Unlike the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which relies solely on the market risk factor (beta), APT considers multiple risk factors that may affect asset prices. @-1/&0/ APT assumes that assets with similar risk characteristics should have similar expected returns, and any deviation from this equilibrium presents an opportunity for arbitrage.@@@
ListPage¤Arbitrage Pricing Theory@-1/&0/APT relies on a linear regression framework to estimate the expected return of an asset based on its exposure to various factors. The general form of the APT equation is:*E*(*Ri*)=*Rf*+*βi*1×*RP*1+*βi*2×*RP*2+…+*βik*×*RPk*@1&*E*(*Ri*) is the expected return on the asset/*Rf* is the risk-free rate of return/*βi*1,*βi*2,…,*βik* are the factor sensitivities (coefficients) representing the asset's exposure to different risk factors/*RP*1,*RP*2,…,*RPk* are the risk premiums associated with each factor@-1/&0/In practice, the specific factors and their associated risk premiums are identified through empirical analysis or theoretical considerations, and the coefficients are estimated using regression techniques.@@@
TextPage¤The Fama-French Three-Factor Model@-1/&0/The Fama-French Three-Factor Model is an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that incorporates additional factors to explain asset returns. Developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in the 1990s, this model identifies three factors that influence stock returns: market risk (beta), size (market capitalization), and value (book-to-market ratio). @-1/&0/The model's equation is: # *E*(*Ri*)=*Rf*+*βi*,*M*×(*E*(*RM*)−*Rf*)+*βi*,*SMB*×*SMB*+*βi*,*HML*×*HML*@@@
