TextPage¤What Is a 3-Fund Portfolio?@-1/&0/By using just three funds, you can simplify not only the implementation but the ongoing management of your investments. @-1/&0/This is because, with fewer funds, you have less to track and fewer transactions to make when adding money to your portfolio or rebalancing it than you would with a portfolio that contains many more investments. @-1/&0/Index funds are a popular choice for this strategy because they have lower expenses than active funds and provide diversification across an entire asset class.@@@

TextPage¤Using ETFs for a Three-Fund Portfolio@-1/&0/You can build a 3-fund portfolio using mutual funds or ETFs, but the costs that come with ETFs are close to one-third of the average cost of a mutual fund. @-1/&0/Which means if you were to build a three-fund portfolio from mutual funds, you'd likely pay three times as much in fees as you would for an ETF-based portfolio.# Since each of the three ETFs may hold thousands of different domestic and international securities, your fund will be very diverse. @-1/&0/Less asset movement within the portfolio, combined with much lower fees, means that you keep more of your capital invested. That will increase the value of your portfolio by that much more.@@@
TextPage¤Building a Three-Fund ETF Portfolio@-1/&0/You can begin your investment plan by thinking about asset allocation and where the assets will be located. @-1/&0/Decide how much of your portfolio you want to put in each ETF, based on your risk tolerance.# To build your own three-fund portfolio, start by figuring out what your objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon are. @-1/&0/This is the first step of any investment strategy to determine your asset allocation and make sure that your investment plan is right for you.@47/1/185@@

TextPage¤Rebalancing Your Portfolio@-1/&0/After your portfolio has been created, you may also find it necessary to periodically rebalance your portfolio’s holdings in order to maintain the same asset allocations. @-1/&0/For example, emerging markets may outperform over the course of several months and hold an oversized position in a portfolio, which increases the risk of the portfolio. You may then want to sell off some of those holdings and invest in developed markets to reduce risk. # You should look at your portfolio often as you move through your career and gain new capital, but also as you reach certain lifetime milestones. @-1/&0/Your goals and tolerance for risk may change, for instance, if you get married, start a family, or buy a home.@@@
