ListPage¤Risks of Bonds@-1/&0/@-1/&0/Bonds are a great way to earn income because they tend to be relatively safe investments. But, just like any other investment, they do come with certain risks. Here are some of the most common :@-1/&0/- Interest Rate Risk@-1/&0/- Credit Risk@-1/&0/- Prepayment Risk@-1/&0/- Inflation risk@-1/&0/- Liquidity risk@-1/&0/- Currency risk@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Interest Rate Risk@-1/&0/Interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds, so when rates rise, bonds tend to fall, and vice versa. @-1/&0/Interest rate risk comes when rates change significantly from what the investor expected. @-1/&0/If interest rates decline significantly, the investor faces the possibility of prepayment. @-1/&0/If interest rates rise, the investor will be stuck with an instrument yielding below market rates. @-1/&0/The greater the time to maturity, the greater the interest rate risk an investor bears, because it is harder to predict market developments further into the future.@@@
TextPage¤Credit/Default Risk@-1/&0/Credit or default risk is the risk that interest and principal payments due on the obligation will not be made as required. @-1/&0/When an investor buys a bond, they expect that the issuer will make good on the interest and principal payments—just like any other creditor. @-1/&0/When an investor looks into corporate bonds, they should weigh out the possibility that the company may default on the debt. @-1/&0/Safety usually means the company has greater operating income and cash flow compared to its debt. @-1/&0/If the inverse is true and the debt outweighs available cash, the investor may want to stay away.@@@
TextPage¤Prepayment Risk@-1/&0/Prepayment risk is the risk that a given bond issue will be paid off earlier than expected, normally through a call provision. @-1/&0/This can be bad news for investors because the company only has an incentive to repay the obligation early when interest rates have declined substantially. @-1/&0/Instead of continuing to hold a high-interest investment, investors are left to reinvest funds in a lower-interest-rate environment.@@@
TextPage¤Inflation risk@-1/&0/Inflation risk, also known as purchasing power risk, refers to the risk that you could lose purchasing power if inflation picks up. @-1/&0/Most bond investments make fixed interest payments, meaning they won't change even if prices elsewhere are rising.@-1/&0/ @@@
TextPage¤Liquidity risk@-1/&0/Liquidity risk is the measure of how easily a security can be sold without incurring high transaction costs or a reduction in price. @-1/&0/We generally suggest investors plan to hold their bonds to maturity, at which time the bond will pay back full par value (assuming no default).@-1/&0/ @@@
TextPage¤Currency risk@-1/&0/Currency risk, also known as exchange rate risk, is present with bonds that are denominated in foreign currencies. @-1/&0/Currency fluctuations can impact bond payments when they are converted to U.S. dollars.# If a foreign currency weakens after the bond is purchased, the value of the bond and the income payments may decline, negatively impacting your return.@@@
