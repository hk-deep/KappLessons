ListPage¤How to Buy Stocks@-1/&0/There is more than one way to invest in stocks. You can opt for any one of the following approaches or use all four. How you buy stocks depends on your investment goals and how actively involved you’d like to be in managing your portfolio.@2&Buy individual stocks/Invest in stock mutual funds/Buy stock ETFs/Trade index futures@-1/&0/Keep in mind that there’s no right or wrong way to invest in stocks. Each way has its own benefits, although for beginners we would strongly recommend to start with ETFs.@@@
TextPage¤Individual stocks@-1/&0/You can buy stock directly using a brokerage account or one of the many available investment apps. These platforms give you the options to buy, sell, and store your purchased stocks on your home computer or smartphone. The only differences among them are mostly in fees and available resources.@-1/&0/However this route involves an important amount of work to research and monitor your investments, and will involve you paying special attention to diversification of your stock portfolio. #More on that later. @-1/&0/You can also join an investment club if you don't want to go it alone. Joining one can give you more information at a reasonable cost, but it takes a lot of time to meet with the other club members, all of whom may have various levels of expertise.@@@
TextPage¤Stock mutual funds@-1/&0/If you don't want to pick individual stocks, but want to own stocks regardless, your best bet is a mutual fund—most likely a low-cost index fund.@-1/&0/The fund managers buy stocks on your behalf, holding them in a centralized, consolidated portfolio that is, itself, divided into shares that you own. In addition to any commission you have to pay, you'll indirectly pay your share of the fund's cost, which is expressed as the mutual fund expense ratio.@-1/&0/Actively managed mutual funds have managers that pick different stocks in an attempt to beat a benchmark index. When you buy shares of a stock mutual fund, your profits come from dividends, interest income and capital gains. Lower-cost index funds are mutual funds that work more like ETFs.@@@
TextPage¤Stock ETFs@-1/&0/Mutual funds share certain similarities with ETFs, but there are important differences.@-1/&0/Exchange-traded funds buy many individual stocks to track an underlying index.@-1/&0/When you invest in an ETF, it’s like buying stocks from a very broad selection of companies that are in the same sector or comprise a stock index, like the S&P 500. One huge difference is that ETF shares trade on exchanges like stocks, but they provide greater diversification than owning an individual stock.@@@
TextPage¤Index Futures@-1/&0/Stock index futures (or Equity index futures) are legal agreements to buy or sell a stock index on a future date and at a specific price.@-1/&0/Stock index futures give you trading access to all stocks on an index at a much lower cost. Stock index futures are available for a wide variety of international indexes and industry-specific indexes.@-1/&0/Stock index futures are amongst the most liquid and widely used instruments. Stock index futures can allow investors to invest on stock index prices, but they are also very risky if prices change too quickly, and hence are to be handled with care.@@@
