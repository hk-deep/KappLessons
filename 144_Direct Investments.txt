ListPage¤Direct Investments@-1/&0/@-1/&0/Direct investments are specific asset class holdings or securities that generate an investment return.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/Direct investments do not have a professional portfolio management team selecting the investments for the investor. Instead, the investor has complete control over which assets or securities to purchase.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/Some examples of direct investments include:@-1/&0/- Savings Accounts@-1/&0/- Money Market Accounts@-1/&0/- Real Estate@-1/&0/- Stocks@-1/&0/- Bonds@-1/&0/- Forex@-1/&0/- Commodities@-1/&0/- Derivatives@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Savings Account@-1/&0/Although it’s not commonly looked upon as one, a traditional savings account is one of the most commonly used investment vehicles in the world. @-1/&0/Although savings accounts don’t offer very high interest rates, they do build your money over time. However, they’re also one that leads to diminishing returns. # Nonetheless, most consumers are willing to take inflation-related losses over time for the peace of mind in knowing they have a safety net built into their savings accounts. @-1/&0/This common investment vehicle is more about holding value than about generating big gains.@@@
TextPage¤Money Market Account@-1/&0/Money market accounts are common investment vehicles similar to savings accounts. These accounts are opened in and managed by banks, and they pay interest. @-1/&0/Unlike savings accounts, the money you invest in a money market account is used by the bank for its own investments in financial markets. # The bank pays you a larger interest rate on these accounts than what you see with traditional savings accounts in exchange for the permission to use your money in financial market transactions. @-1/&0/The balance of your account remains available for you to withdraw when you need to, just as with a savings account.@@@
TextPage¤Real Estate@-1/&0/When you think about real estate investing, the first thing that probably comes to mind is your home. But real estate investors have lots of other options when it comes to choosing investments, and they're not all physical properties. @-1/&0/Real estate is a broad asset class that includes both public and private investments as well as both equity and debt securities. # It is often touted as a good investment thanks to its potential to improve both returns and portfolio diversification. @-1/&0/Real estate as an investment asset includes private equity investments in commercial or residential properties, private debt securities for similar properties, publicly traded real estate equity (offered via real estate investment trusts), and publicly traded real estate debt (offered via mortgage-backed securities).@@@
TextPage¤Bonds@-1/&0/Bonds are another commonly known investment vehicle. While they’re known for smaller returns than stocks, they’re also considered to be safer investments.# Moreover, returns on bonds often outpace inflation-related risks.@-1/&0/In the simplest of terms, a bond is a loan — the investor gives this loan to a publicly traded company or government municipality.# When purchased, bonds come with a maturity date and coupon rate.@-1/&0/The maturity date represents the date on which the bond becomes liquid and the borrower pays back the debt in full.# The coupon rate acts as an interest rate and represents the return on investment the investor can expect to realize.@@@
TextPage¤Stocks@-1/&0/If you’re like most people, when you hear the term “investment” the first thing that comes to mind is stocks.# Stocks are the first investment vehicle on this list that are likely to outpace inflation and provide cumulative gains.@-1/&0/Stocks are financial instruments that represent shares of ownership in a publicly traded company.# Shares of stock in a company also grant the shareholder voting power.@-1/&0/Moreover, some stocks pay dividends, which are a portion of the profits created over a period of time that are paid out to shareholders.# Dividends offer an additional opportunity to realize gains from your investments outside of the standard growth in value seen in your shares.@@@
TextPage¤Foreign Currencies@-1/&0/Forex (FX) refers to the global electronic marketplace for trading international currencies and currency derivatives.@-1/&0/It has no central physical location, yet the forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world by trading volume, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day.# Most of the trading is done through banks, brokers, and financial institutions.@-1/&0/The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for some holidays.@@@
TextPage¤Precious Metals@-1/&0/Precious metals including platinum, gold, silver, and others are another popular investment vehicle.# That’s right, the necklace you’re wearing is a valuable commodity.@-1/&0/Precious metals are safe-haven investment vehicles.# That means when economic or market conditions are concerning, investors look to precious metals as a way to protect their investments from losses.@-1/&0/As a result of the increased demand for precious metals in the midst of tough economic and market conditions, the values of these metals tend to rise during these times.@@@
TextPage¤Commodities@-1/&0/A commodity is a basic good traded in large volumes and interchangeable with other goods of the same type.# Commodities are typically sorted into four broad categories: metal, energy, livestock and meat, and agricultural products.@-1/&0/For investors, commodities can be an important way to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional securities.@-1/&0/Commodities are considered risky investments because the supply and demand of these products are affected by events that are difficult to predict, such as weather, epidemics, and natural and human-made disasters.@@@
TextPage¤Derivatives@-1/&0/Derivatives are financial contracts based on the value of an underlying asset, group of assets or benchmark.# These underlying assets can include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indexes.@-1/&0/Because the value of derivatives comes from other assets, professional traders tend to buy and sell them to offset risk.@-1/&0/For less experienced investors, however, derivatives can have the opposite effect, making their investment portfolios much riskier.@@@
