Here are some tips for buying a house in a seller's market:@-1/&0/- A hot real estate market occurs when there is greater demand for housing than available homes.@-1/&0/- Get a mortgage preapproval to help reduce time and be an attractive buyer.@-1/&0/- Be ready to pay more for a home because values are up in a seller's market.@-1/&0/- Find a great agent who can help you be selective and widen your search.@-1/&0/- Be prepared to act quickly if you find the home you want.@@@

This results in fierce competition between buyers seeking to purchase from a limited pool of properties.@-1/&0/The market is cyclical, however.@-1/&0/A buyer's market is just the opposite. There are more properties for sale than interested buyers.@-1/&0/Unlike a buyer's market, a hot market moves quickly, so you'll need to move quickly.@@@

Anything you can do to reduce the time it takes to close will work to your advantage.@-1/&0/A mortgage preapproval is one of the best ways to increase your chances of getting the house you want because it can speed up the process.@-1/&0/Some sellers may not entertain offers from prospective homebuyers if they don't have preapprovals.@-1/&0/Additionally, some realtors have taken to requiring proof of preapproval before they even work with you.@@@

With a finger on the market's pulse, they can show you properties you wouldn't otherwise find.@-1/&0/Even more important? Relationships.@-1/&0/The highest-rated agents typically have great relationships with listing agents in the area.@-1/&0/This can be the difference between you getting your offer accepted when you're competing against 20+ other buyers.@@@

Their goal is to make a return for their investors and partners by investing funds in the market. @-1/&0/The supply side is dominated by the major global banks, whose job is to facilitate the trading of investors. @-1/&0/Retail investors are typically non-professionals who are trading with their own capital in order to make a return on their investment.

If you are going to sell a stock, you will receive a price at or near the posted bid. @-1/&0/One important thing to remember is that the last traded price is not necessarily the price at which the market order will be executed. @-1/&0/In fast-moving and volatile markets, the price at which you actually execute (or fill) the trade can deviate from the last traded price.@@@

An all-or-none order ensures that you get either the entire quantity of stock you requested or none at all. @-1/&0/This is typically problematic when a stock is very illiquid or a limit is placed on the order. @-1/&0/For example, if you put in an order to buy 2,000 shares of XYZ but only 1,000 are being sold, an all-or-none restriction means your order will not be filled until there are at least 2,000 shares available at your preferred price. @-1/&0/If you don't place an all-or-none restriction, your 2,000 share order would be partially filled for 1,000 shares.@@@

Error1:File: C:/Users/Khalil/Documents/Kapplessons\150_Bond Varieties.txt, Line 4: TextPage¤Callable Bonds@-1/&0/A callable bond is one that can be “called” back by the company before it matures. @-1/&0/Assume that a company has borrowed $1 million by issuing bonds with a 10% coupon that mature in 10 years. If interest rates decline (or the company’s credit rating improves) in year five when the company could borrow for 8%, they will call or buy the bonds back from the bondholders for the principal amount and reissue new bonds at a lower coupon rate. @-1/&0/A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. @-1/&0/Remember, when interest rates are falling, bond prices rise. Because of this, callable bonds are not as valuable as bonds that aren’t callable with the same maturity, credit rating, and coupon rate.@@@

Error1:File: C:/Users/Khalil/Documents/Kapplessons\150_Bond Varieties.txt, Line 5: TextPage¤Puttable Bond@-1/&0/A puttable bond allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. @-1/&0/This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. @-1/&0/The bond issuer may include a put option in the bond that benefits the bondholders in return for a lower coupon rate or to induce the bond sellers to make the initial loan. @-1/&0/A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.@@@
