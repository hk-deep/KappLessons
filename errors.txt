To do so, XYZ issues shares equal to $5.5 million, discounting the initial purchase to drive institutional interest.@-1/&0/However, these shares may be sold as units that include rights to purchase additional shares at or near the price of the offering. Once the maturity date of these rights comes to fruition, investors can exercise their right to purchase newly issued shares or decide not to.@-1/&0/This would mean a significant extra gain for rights holders if XYZ’s stock soars — they can buy more shares of the stock at or near the original offering price.@@@

Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it.@-1/&0/There are so many financial markets, and every country is home to at least one, although they vary in size.
