ListPage¤Why invest in Stocks@-1/&0/It's impossible to predict the stock market's movement, but amidst the unpredictability, the benefits of investing in stocks remain unchanged.@2&Outrun Inflation/Grow Your Wealth/Diversify Your Investments@-1/&0/In addition to investing some of your available cash in a savings account, consider the reasons why stocks continue to be a viable investment and why you should invest in the stock market.@@@
TextPage¤Outrun Inflation@-1/&0/Inflation, the reduced purchasing power of a currency over time, is not your friend when you’re trying to save for a significant purchase, buy a house, or finance a comfortable retirement.@-1/&0/Consider that most central banks try to keep inflation at around 2%. Then think about how this could reduce the purchasing power of money sitting in a certificate of deposit (CD) or savings account.@-1/&0/Any account or investment needs to earn at least 2% to keep up with inflation. Unfortunately, even high-yield savings accounts don't offer rates that high.@@@
TextPage¤Grow Your Wealth@-1/&0/If you decide to invest in stocks to grow your wealth, understand that there’s no guarantee of how your stocks will perform.#Still, it’s unnecessary to buy stock in the next Amazon or Apple to earn a respectable return.@-1/&0/Consider that the stock market has averaged an 8% annual return on investments, as measured by the S&P 500 in the past 50 years.@-1/&0/This is despite the stock market's volatility and its tendency to change rapidly, which from time to time culminates in a historic crash characterized by a sudden double-digit decline in value.@@@
TextPage¤Diversify Your Investments@-1/&0/Diversify your investments by including some stocks, along with your bonds (and other fixed-income securities). @-1/&0/CDs and savings or money market accounts can help protect you from the financial markets' inherent volatility. # Often, when the stock market is down, the bond market is up and vice versa. @-1/&0/This boils down to an ability to better control volatility (otherwise known as risk) by strategically placing money in investments and bonds.@@@
TextPage¤It's More Affordable Than You Think@-1/&0/Investing in the stock market is a well-worn path to making your money work for you, but you don’t have to fork over thousands of dollars to start. @-1/&0/You can begin by setting aside the few dollars you would normally spend on a daily latte and invest the amount you saved in stocks or an index fund. # It’s a virtually painless way to use your earnings in the service of your future. @-1/&0/This is even more true now because you don't need to save up large amounts of money to get started. Over a period of years, your stock holdings and earnings compound and grow at an accelerating rate.@@@
TextPage¤You Don't Have to Be a Genius@-1/&0/A seasoned investor might have an advantage over you as you're getting started, but you don't have to be a math whiz, wealthy, or another Warren Buffett to invest in the stock market. @-1/&0/Compared to investing in a franchise or creating your own business from the ground up, the requirements for investing in the stock market are modest. @-1/&0/If you have an understanding of fifth-grade math—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals and ratios—you more than likely can understand investing concepts with time and research.@@@
