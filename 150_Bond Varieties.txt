ListPage¤Bond Varieties@-1/&0/The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties. They can be separated by the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. Below, we list some of the most common variations:@1&Zero-Coupon Bonds/Convertible Bonds/Callable Bonds/Puttable Bonds@-1/&0/The possible combinations of embedded puts, calls, and convertibility rights in a bond are endless, and each one is unique. Although the chances of you buying into one of these issues if you’re a beginner is pretty slim, it’s important to know that these variations exist.@@@
TextPage¤Zero-Coupon Bonds@-1/&0/Most bonds make regular interest or "coupon" payments, but not zero coupon bonds. Zeros, as they are sometimes called, are bonds that pay no coupon or interest payment. @-1/&0/With a zero, instead of getting interest payments, you buy the bond at a discount from the face value of the bond and are paid the face amount when the bond matures. @-1/&0/For example, you might pay $3,500 to purchase a 20-year zero coupon bond with a face value of $10,000. After 20 years, the issuer of the bond pays you $10,000. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are often purchased to meet a future expense such as college costs or an anticipated expenditure in retirement.@@@
TextPage¤Convertible Bonds@-1/&0/Convertible bonds are debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price. @-1/&0/The investors who purchase a convertible bond can profit from the upside in the stock if the project is successful. @-1/&0/They are taking more risk by accepting a lower coupon payment, but the potential reward if the bonds are converted could make that trade-off acceptable.@@@
TextPage¤Callable Bonds@-1/&0/A callable bond is one that can be “called” back by the company before it matures. #Assume that a company has borrowed $1 million by issuing bonds with a 10% coupon that mature in 10 years. If interest rates decline (or the company’s credit rating improves) in year five when the company could borrow for 8%, they will call or buy the bonds back from the bondholders for the principal amount and reissue new bonds at a lower coupon rate. @-1/&0/A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. @-1/&0/Remember, when interest rates are falling, bond prices rise. Because of this, callable bonds are not as valuable as bonds that aren’t callable with the same maturity, credit rating, and coupon rate.@@@
TextPage¤Puttable Bond@-1/&0/A puttable bond allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. #This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. @-1/&0/The bond issuer may include a put option in the bond that benefits the bondholders in return for a lower coupon rate or to induce the bond sellers to make the initial loan. @-1/&0/A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.@@@
