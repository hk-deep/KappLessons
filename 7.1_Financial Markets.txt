TextPage¤Types of Financial Markets@-1/&0/There are several different types of markets. Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it.@-1/&0/There are so many financial markets, and every country is home to at least one, although they vary in size. Some are small, while others are internationally known, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which trades trillions of dollars daily.@-1/&0/They vary not only in size but also by the type of financial instrument available on it, their function, and by the way they are organized.@-1/&0/Financial markets can also be broken down into capital markets, money markets, primary vs. secondary markets, and listed vs. OTC markets.@@@
TextPage¤Listed vs OTC Markets@-1/&0/Most securities are listed and traded on regulated exchanges. These would include most of the stock exchanges that you regularly hear about, like the NYSE or Nasdaq.@-1/&0/An over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market—meaning it does not have physical locations, and trading is conducted electronically—in which market participants trade securities directly (meaning without a broker).@-1/&0/While OTC markets may handle trading in certain stocks (e.g., smaller or riskier companies that do not meet the listing criteria of exchanges), most stock trading is done via exchanges.@-1/&0/Broadly speaking, OTC markets and the transactions that occur in them are far less regulated, less liquid, and more opaque, and are usually only accessible to professional investors.@@@
TextPage¤Primary vs Secondary Markets@-1/&0/When you buy a new sweater at the store, you're making a purchase on a primary market—that sweater had never been offered to the public before. Pick up a similar sweater at a thrift shop, and you've made a stop on the secondary market.@-1/&0/The financial markets also have primary and secondary markets.@-1/&0/The primary market is where new securities are issued, with the issuing companies and governments selling to financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers or directly to investors.@-1/&0/After that first issuance, wherever the security (a bond or a share of stock, for example) changes hands, it does so in a secondary market such as an exchange.@36/1/139@@
ListPage¤Examples of Financial Markets@-1/&0/Financial Markets are broad in scope and scale. Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market, the bond market, forex, commodities, and the real estate market, among others:@2&Stock Markets/Bond Markets/Money Markets/Forex Market/Commodities Markets/Derivatives Markets/Cryptocurrency Markets@-1/&0/@36/2/140@@
TextPage¤How Exchanges Work@-1/&0/Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations, all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another. @-1/&0/This is often done through an auction or price-discovery mechanism. @-1/&0/When most people think of a stock exchange, they envision the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shouting brokers negotiating buys and sells via hand signals.@@@
TextPage¤How Exchanges Work@-1/&0/On a physical exchange like the NYSE, "market makers" who specialize in a particular stock will buy and sell that stock to brokers. @-1/&0/The trading floor functions like an auction house, with bid and offer prices changing throughout the trading day. @-1/&0/But most exchanges have changed over to electronic trading platforms. Electronic exchanges work in a similar way, except that it's computers that connect buyers and sellers.@36/3/141@@
TextPage¤The Order Book@-1/&0/When all these participants want to buy or sell (i.e. execute a transaction) on a financial instrument, they have to access its order book through the broker. @-1/&0/An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a security or other instrument organized by price level. @-1/&0/Order books are used by almost every exchange for various assets like stocks, bonds, currencies, and even cryptocurrencies. @-1/&0/These lists help improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability, depth of trade, and who initiates transactions.@36/4/142@@
ListPage¤Order Types and Execution@-1/&0/@-1/&0/A market order simply buys (or sells) shares at the prevailing market prices until the order is filled.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/A limit order specifies a certain price at which the order must be filled, although there is no guarantee that some or all of the order will trade if the limit is set too high or low.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/Stop orders, a type of market order, are triggered when a stock moves above or below a certain level; they are often used as a way to insure against larger losses or to lock in profits.@-1/&0/@@-1/&0/Orders that specify execution only at market open or market close are maintained separately. These are known as the “opening order” and “closing order” respectively.@-1/&0/@36/5/143@@
