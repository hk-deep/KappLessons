TextPage¤Asset classes risk profiles@-1/&0/Different asset classes exhibit varying levels of risk. Stocks for example are typically associated with higher volatility and potential for higher returns, making them more suitable for long-term investors seeking growth. @-1/&0/ Bonds offer lower risk and income through interest payments but may provide lower returns. Real estate investments offer income and potential appreciation but are subject to market fluctuations and liquidity constraints.@-1/&0/@@@
ImagePage¤Comparing risks@-1/&0/One of the best-documented propositions in the field of finance is that, on average, investors have received higher rates of return for bearing greater risk.@0@-1/&0@@@
ImagePage¤Comparing risks@-1/&0/This is shown in the following table. For several investment vehicles—stocks, bonds, and Treasury bills—we measure the percentage increase or decrease each year for each item, and draw a distribution of these returns.@1@-1/&0/This shows that in the long run, common stocks have provided relatively high total rates of return, that exceeded by a substantial margin the returns from long-term bonds and inflation.@@@
TextPage¤Reducing risk@-1/&0/Portfolio Theory, pioneered by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, emphasizes that investors are inherently risk-averse and seek high returns with guaranteed outcomes. @-1/&0/Markowitz's work led to the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990. His theory outlines how investors can combine stocks and bonds in their portfolios to minimize risk while achieving desired returns.@-1/&0/Diversification, a key principle, allows for risk reduction by combining assets with low correlation. Markowitz's research showed that even imperfect correlation can contribute to risk reduction, highlighting the importance of the correlation coefficient in portfolio construction.@@@
TextPage¤Modern Portfolio Theory@-1/&0/The Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) developed by Markowitz revolutionized investment strategy by emphasizing the importance of diversification in reducing portfolio risk. @-1/&0/The theory suggests that by combining assets with different risk and return profiles, investors can optimize their portfolios to achieve a desired level of return while minimizing risk.@@@
ImagePage¤Modern Portfolio Theory@-1/&0/MPT utilizes mathematical models to identify the most efficient portfolios, known as the "efficient frontier," based on risk-return trade-offs. @2@-1/&0/Despite its complexities, MPT remains a cornerstone of modern finance and guides investors in constructing well-diversified portfolios tailored to their risk preferences and investment goals.@@@

TextPage¤The Limits of Diversification@-1/&0/Diversification, while a powerful risk management tool, reaches a point of diminishing returns. @-1/&0/Research indicates that holding fifty diversified stocks can reduce portfolio risk by over 60 percent. Beyond this threshold, additional holdings yield minimal risk reduction.@-1/&0/ International diversification provides enhanced risk mitigation compared to a purely domestic portfolio. Over time, the benefits of international diversification have been evident, with foreign stocks offering slightly uncorrelated returns compared to domestic stocks, hence reducing overall portfolio volatility.@@@

LessonQuizPage¤Which of the following statements highlights a *limit of diversification*?@-1/&0@A) Diversification can eliminate all risks from a portfolio./B) Diversification reduces specific risk but cannot eliminate systematic risk./C) Diversification guarantees higher returns in every market condition./D) Diversification is only effective when all assets perform identically.@@0/1/0/0@
LessonQuizPage¤Why can’t systematic risk be completely eliminated from a portfolio?@-1/&0@A) Because it is related to unpredictable individual events./B) Because it arises from factors affecting the entire market, like inflation or economic downturns./C) Because it is the risk associated with a specific company or industry./D) Because systematic risk only applies to bonds.@@0/1/0/0@
