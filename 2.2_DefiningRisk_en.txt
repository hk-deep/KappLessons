TextPage¤Defining Risk@-1/&0/So how would you define risk? As it happens, it’s quite hard to agree on a precise definition of risk, it being such a slippery concept, but you can see it as the possibility of suffering harm or loss. @-1/&0/For example, if you buy one-year Government Bonds to yield 2 percent and hold them until they mature, you are virtually certain of earning a 2 percent monetary return. The possibility of loss is so small as to be considered non-existent.@-1/&0/ If you hold common stock for one year, anticipating a 5 percent dividend return, the possibility of loss is greater. The dividend of the company may be cut and, more importantly, the market price at the end of the year may be much lower, causing you to suffer a net loss.@@@
TextPage¤The Dispersion of Returns@-1/&0/Investment risk, then, can be seen as the probability that expected returns will not materialize and, in particular, that the financial instruments you hold will fall in price. Risk can hence be understood as to the probability of being esapointed by the investment’s returns. @-1/See definition later&0/Thus, financial risk has generally been defined by the &1/variance or standard deviation of returns, &0/ i.e., how much the return in any given year will differ from the average of returns in past years.@-1/&0/A security whose returns are not likely to depart much, if at all, from its expected return is said to carry little or no risk. A security whose returns from year to year are likely to be quite variable (and for which sharp losses occur in some years) is said to be risky.@@@
ImagePage¤Variance@-1/&0/Let’s see an example to illustrate the idea. #Say you have to choose between 2 financial instruments (bonds, stocks or other …) #Here are the (over simplified) distributions of return of both instruments in various cases @0@@@@
TextPage¤Variance@-1/&0/If, on average, a third of &1/past years&0/ have been “normal,” another third characterized by rapid growth without inflation, and the remaining third characterized by “stagflation,” it might be reasonable to take these relative frequencies of past events and treat them as your best guesses (probabilities)* of the likelihood of future business conditions. @-1/&0/So which one will you pick ?@-1/&0/@@@
ImagePage¤Risk vs Return@-1/&0/The “expected return” is a measure of what, on average, the yearly return for each investment will be.@1@ @-1/&0/It turns out to be 10 percent for both instruments.@6/1/112@@  
ImagePage¤Risk vs Return@-1/&0/The “variance” is a measure of the dispersion of returns. It is defined as the average squared deviation of each possible return from its expected value, which we in our example is 10 percent.@2@-1/&0/As you can see, both investment have the same expected return but one of them has a higher variance, and is hence more volatile / uncertain / risky. So now, which one will you pick ? @6/1/112@@  
ImagePage¤Risk Types@-1/&0/Is that all you need to know about Risk? #Behind this seemingly simple definition of risk (uncertainty of outcomes) lies a wide variety of investment risks which can manifest in different forms, each carrying its own set of challenges and considerations, and each influencing investment outcomes differently:@3@@6/2/113@@
TextPage¤Systematic vs. Specific Risk@-1/&0/These risks fall into one of two categories: Systematic Risk and Unsystematic Risk. @-1/&0/Systematic risk, also known as market risk, pertains to factors that affect the entire market, such as economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events, impacting all investments to some degree. @-1/&0/Unsystematic risk, on the other hand, is specific to individual assets or industries, arising from factors like company performance, management issues, or regulatory changes, and can be mitigated through diversification.@@@
ImagePage¤Systematic vs. Specific Risk@-1/&0/You can’t avoid systematic risk when you invest, but you can, and you must do your best to, reduce or mitigate unsystematic risk.@4@@@@
ListPage¤Risk Measurement@-1/&0/If you want to assess the likelihood and impact of adverse outcomes you’ll find various ways to quantify Risk, depending on what you want to measure :@1&Standard deviation measures the dispersion of returns around the average, indicating volatility./Beta measures how much an asset’s movements are correlated to the overall market movements. It reflects the systematic risk of the asset./Value at Risk (VaR) estimates the maximum potential loss within a specified confidence level./Credit risk measures the likelihood of a default by the issuer on the bond you hold.@-1/&0/@6/3/114@@
ImagePage¤Risk Measurement@-1/&0/All these are usually summarised in one measure : Volatility. Volatility is the measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates over time, indicating its level of risk and uncertainty.@5@-1/&0/Higher volatility means higher risk, and potentially higher returns.
