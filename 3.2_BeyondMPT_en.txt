TextPage¤Beyond MPT@-1/&0/According to the financial literature, MPT is the optimum way to create a portfolio by combining different asset classes. This construction depends crucially on the market risk and return of each asset class and on the correlations between different asset classes.@-1/&0/However, the needs of individual investors impose different considerations than simply the averages of the market.#The emphasis of the efficient frontier approach using market risks, without consideration for its effect on the portfolio holder, is fundamentally unsatisfactory.@-1/&0/Each investor, based on his personal utility function, should find the appropriate allocation between different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash.@@@
ListPage¤Towards a Personal Asset Allocation@-1/&0/Hang on, utility function, what does that mean ?#Utility Function is just a fancy expression to say that some factors will influence your choices, and those are :@1&Your constraints/Your preferences/Your goals/Your risk tolerance/Your lifecycle/Your lifestyle@-1/&0/Keep in mind it’s important that you define each element in order to achieve the right balance of your portfolio.@@@
ListPage¤Taking Time into Consideration@-1/&0/In addition, the MPT efficient frontier approach optimizes for a portfolio’s outcome at the end of a single predetermined time period. There are at least two problems with this :@2&Investors need to maintain their lifestyle and meet their financial obligations during this time period regardless of market conditions./We do not always know at the outset what the specified time period should be. For example, we need to provide for retirement without knowing exactly how long we will live.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Personal Risk@-1/&0/Besides, in the standard framework, risk is defined by the volatility of the underlying portfolio.@-1/&0/Volatility is a one-dimensional measure of market risk which tracks how much the price of the portfolio fluctuates, on the average, over a specified period of time.#The assumption that the market returns have no memory breaks down often, due in part to the impact of economic cycles.@-1/&0/@13/1/122@@
TextPage¤Personal Risk@-1/&0/These cycles create bull and bear markets that consist of closely spaced or successive years of economic feast or famine.@-1/&0/The consequences on the individual investor of such large deviations or several consecutive years of negative returns may range from mere annoyance to catastrophe.#In other words, the market understands risks only at an aggregate level, not at an individual level.@-1/&0/@@@
ImagePage¤The Journey Matters@-1/&0/Personal risk is thus an additional dimension that must be factored in to construct appropriate portfolios for individuals. This consideration also makes the problem path-dependent. @0@-1/&0/Clearly the journey matters. A stream may have an average depth of five feet, but a traveler wading through it will not make it to the other side if its mid-point is 10 feet deep. Similarly, an overly volatile investing strategy may sink an investor before she gets to reap its anticipated rewards.@@@
