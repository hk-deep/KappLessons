ListPage¤Asset Allocation Strategies@-1/&0/There are several different strategies for establishing asset allocations, and they can be active to varying degrees or strictly passive in nature :@2&Strategic Asset Allocation/Constant-Weighting Asset Allocation/Tactical Asset Allocation/Dynamic Asset Allocation@-1/&0/You can pick and choose or mix these approaches. However keep in mind these are only general guidelines and be aware that allocation approaches that involve reacting to market movements require a great deal of expertise and time.@@@
TextPage¤Strategic Asset Allocation@-1/&0/This method establishes and adheres to a base policy mix—a proportional combination of assets based on expected rates of return for each asset class. @-1/&0/You set your targets and then rebalance your portfolio every now and then. @-1/&0/A strategic asset allocation strategy may be akin to a buy-and-hold strategy and also heavily suggests diversification to cut back on risk and improve returns.@@@
TextPage¤Constant-Weighting Asset Allocation@-1/&0/Strategic asset allocation generally implies a buy-and-hold strategy, even as the shift in values of assets causes a drift from the initially established policy mix. @-1/&0/For this reason, you may prefer to adopt a constant-weighting approach to asset allocation. @-1/&0/With this approach, you continually rebalance your portfolio.@@@
TextPage¤Constant-Weighting Asset Allocation@-1/&0/For example, if one asset declines in value, you would purchase more of that asset. And if that asset value increases, you would sell it. @-1/&0/There are no hard-and-fast rules for timing portfolio rebalancing under strategic or constant-weighting asset allocation. @-1/&0/But a common rule of thumb is that the portfolio should be rebalanced to its original mix when any given asset class moves more than 5% from its original value.@@@
TextPage¤Tactical Asset Allocation@-1/&0/Over the long run, a strategic asset allocation strategy may seem relatively rigid. Therefore, you may find it necessary to occasionally engage in short-term, tactical deviations from the mix to capitalize on unusual or exceptional investment opportunities. @-1/&0/This flexibility adds a market-timing component to the portfolio, allowing you to participate in economic conditions more favorable for one asset class than for others. @-1/&0/Tactical asset allocation can be described as a moderately active strategy since the overall strategic asset mix is returned to when desired short-term profits are achieved.@@@
TextPage¤Dynamic Asset Allocation@-1/&0/With this strategy, you constantly adjust the mix of assets as markets rise and fall, and as the economy strengthens and weakens. With this strategy, you sell assets that decline and purchase assets that increase. @-1/&0/For example, if the stock market shows weakness, you sell stocks in anticipation of further decreases and if the market is strong, you purchase stocks in anticipation of continued market gains. This makes dynamic asset allocation the polar opposite of a constant-weighting strategy. @-1/&0/Dynamic asset allocation relies on your judgment instead of a target mix of assets.@@@
