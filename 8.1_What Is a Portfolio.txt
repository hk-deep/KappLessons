TextPage¤What Is a Portfolio?@-1/&0/If you own any financial assets, you have a portfolio, whether you realize it or not. @-1/&0/A portfolio is the combination of all the assets you own.# Financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and cash are all parts of your investment portfolio, which can also include other assets, like real estate or gold.@@@
ListPage¤How does it Work@-1/&0/The basic premise of an investment portfolio is that you purchase investments, which increase in value, and as a result, you earn money. OK, but does it work.@-1/&0/You use 2 techniques when building your portfolio :@2&Allocation : choosing how much of each asset class you put in your portfolio/Diversification : for each asset class, spread your investments through various instruments.@@@
TextPage¤Asset Allocation@-1/&0/The way you choose the types of assets you buy is referred to as "asset allocation." @-1/&0/Assets fall mainly into three classes: equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and cash and cash equivalents (savings and money market accounts).# Within each main category, you have a number of choices. For instance, equities include individual stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and managed mutual funds.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/To avoid being overly exposed to losses within a single company or industry, you can also choose to diversify your portfolio by buying among a number of investments across many asset classes. @-1/&0/This doesn’t eliminate risk but allows you to lower it within each asset class.# For example, buying shares of 10 different companies will lower your exposure to bad economic events that could happen to one company, but it doesn’t protect you from a global economic issue that would affect all stocks.@@@
