TextPage¤Present Value@-1/&0/Let’s say you have amounts of cash payable at various times in the coming years. What is that flow of cash worth today?@-1/&0/This is not only theoretical. This is how you would value a bond, a company, or a real estate asset, by considering the future income that they will bring. That’s what PV is used for.@@@
TextPage¤Present Value@-1/&0/Present Value (PV) is a financial concept that calculates the current worth of a future sum of money, considering its time-based devaluation.@-1/&0/It involves discounting future cash flows to their current value, reflecting the opportunity cost of not having the money today.# The formula incorporates discount rates and time periods.@@@
TextPage¤Meaning@-1/&0/Imagine you have a choice: someone can give you $100 today, or they can give you $100 a year from now.@-1/&0/Which would you prefer?# Most people would choose to get the $100 today.# Why? Because money today can be used to earn more money over time, either by saving it in a bank, investing it, or just enjoying it now.@@@
TextPage¤Meaning@-1/&0/Present value is a way of figuring out how much future money is worth in today's terms.@-1/&0/It's based on the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.# By using present value, we can compare the value of money we will receive or pay in the future to the value of money we have right now.@-1/&0/To put it simply, present value helps us understand the true worth of future money by taking into account factors like interest rates and inflation. This way, we can make better financial decisions.@@@
TextPage¤Example@-1/&0/Imagine the following scenario: you have the option to receive $100 one year from now. However, you want to know how much that $100 is worth in today's terms. Let's assume the annual interest rate is 5%.@-1/&0/Had you had the $100 today, you could potentially have invested this money and gotten a 5% return in 1 year’s time. In other words, a $100 bill in your pocket today is worth $105 in a year’s time.# A simple cross-multiplication then shows that today, the value of having $100 in one year’s time is: Value = $100 / 1.05 = $95.2.@@@
ListPage¤Formula 1@-1/&0/The present value (PV) formula for 1 year is: PV=FV on (1+r) # Where:@2&PV = Present Value/FV = Future Value ($100 in this example)/r = Interest rate (5% or 0.05 in this example)@@@
TextPage¤Example 2@-1/&0/Now suppose that you can receive $100 in 2 years rather than 1 year, and you want to know how much that is worth today, assuming a 5% interest rate.@-1/&0/Using the same reasoning, if you had $100 today you could invest it and get $100 * 1.05 = $105 in 1 year, then reinvest $105 and get $105 * 1.05 = $110.25 (this is called compounding, more about that later).# Today’s value can then be calculated as: Value = $100 / (1.05)^2 = $90.7.@@@
ImagePage¤General Formula@-1/&0/Now you get the idea, a cash flow CF in year n is worth  CF over (1+r)^n today.#The general formula for a series of multiple cash flows over the future is :@0@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Use@-1/&0/This formula can be used in many situations.@-1/&0/You can use it to calculate the value of a bond, or of your mortgage.# You can also apply it to value annuities.@-1/&0/A variation of this is also used to value companies or stocks (that’s the DCF method that we'll introduce later).@@@
