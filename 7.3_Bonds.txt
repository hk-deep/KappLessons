TextPage¤Bonds@-1/&0/A bond is a loan to a company or government that pays investors a fixed rate of return over a specific timeframe.@-1/&0/Bonds are a key ingredient when building a balanced investments portfolio.@-1/&0/A bond's risk is based mainly on the issuer's creditworthiness. Interest rates also influence a bond's value. The relative safety of bonds helps balance the risks associated with stock-based investments.# Bonds come with many potential benefits, including capital preservation, diversification, income, and potential tax advantages.@@@

TextPage¤What Is a Bond ?@-1/&0/Simply put, a bond is a loan. When you purchase a bond, you provide a loan to the issuer. A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments.@-1/&0/Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.# Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.@@@
TextPage¤How Bonds Work@-1/&0/Bonds are commonly referred to as fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes that individual investors are usually familiar with, along with stocks (equities) and cash equivalents.@-1/&0/When companies or other entities need to raise money to finance new projects, maintain ongoing operations, or refinance existing debts, they may issue bonds directly to investors.# The borrower (issuer) issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the time at which the loaned funds (bond principal) must be paid back (maturity date).@38/1/147@@
ListPage¤Characteristics of Bonds@-1/&0/Most bonds share some common basic characteristics including:@2&Face value (par value) is the reference amount for all other characteristics expressed in percentage terms./Redemption value is the money amount the bond will be worth at maturity./The coupon rate is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage./Coupon dates are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Payments can be made in any interval, but the standard is semiannual payments./The maturity date is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond./The issue price is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In most cases, bonds are issued at par.@-1/&0/@38/2/148@@
TextPage¤Bonds’ Features@-1/&0/Two features of a bond—credit quality and time to maturity—are the principal determinants of a bond's coupon rate at issuance. @-1/&0/If the issuer has a poor credit rating, the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. @-1/&0/Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period.@38/3/149@@
ListPage¤Bond Categories@-1/&0/There are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms.@2&Corporate bonds are issued by companies./Municipal bonds are issued by states and municipalities./Government bonds are issued by the Treasury and are referred to as sovereign debt./Agency bonds are those issued by government-affiliated organizations.@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Bond Varieties@-1/&0/The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties. They can be separated by the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. Below, we list some of the most common variations:@2&Zero-Coupon Bonds/Convertible Bonds/Callable Bonds/Puttable Bonds/The possible combinations of embedded puts, calls, and convertibility rights in a bond are endless, and each one is unique. Although the chances of you buying into one of these issues if you’re a beginner is pretty slim, it’s important to know that these variations exist.@-1/&0/@38/4/150@@
ListPage¤Risks of Bonds@-1/&0/Bonds are a great way to earn income because they tend to be relatively safe investments. But, just like any other investment, they do come with certain risks. Here are some of the most common :@2&Interest Rate Risk/Credit Risk/Prepayment Risk/Inflation risk/Liquidity risk/Currency risk@-1/&0/@38/5/151@@
TextPage¤Bond Ratings@-1/&0/Most bonds come with a rating that outlines their quality of credit—that is, how strong the bond is and its ability to pay its principal and interest. @-1/&0/A bond rating is a grade given by a rating agency that assesses the creditworthiness of the bond's issuer, signifying the likelihood of default.# Ratings are published and used by investors and professionals to judge their worthiness.@38/6/152@@
TextPage¤How Bonds Are Priced@-1/&0/Bond valuation is done by calculating the present value of a bond's future interest payments, also known as its cash flow, and the bond's value upon maturity, also known as its redemption value. @-1/&0/The theoretical fair value of a bond is calculated by discounting the future value of its coupon payments by an appropriate discount rate.# The discount rate used is the yield to maturity, which is the rate of return that an investor will get if they reinvested every coupon payment from the bond at a fixed interest rate until the bond matures.# It takes into account the price of a bond, par value, coupon rate, and time to maturity. @-1/&0/Because a bond's par value and interest payments are fixed, an investor uses bond valuation to determine what rate of return is required for a bond investment to be worthwhile.@38/7/153@@
ListPage¤How to Buy Bonds@-1/&0/To buy bond securities, you have two main choices: individual bonds or bond funds.@2&Individual Bonds/Bond Funds/The choice between individual securities and bond funds depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, desired level of involvement, and the investment exposure you are seeking.@-1/&0/@38/8/154@@
