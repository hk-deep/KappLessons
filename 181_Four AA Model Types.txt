ListPage¤Four Model Types@-1/&0/Most asset-allocation models fall somewhere among four objectives:@2&Preservation of Capital/Income Generation/Balanced/Growth@@@
TextPage¤Preservation of Capital@-1/&0/Asset-allocation models designed for the preservation of capital are largely for those who expect to use their cash within the next 12 months. They often do not wish to risk losing even a small percentage of principal value for the possibility of capital gains.@-1/&0/Those who plan on paying for college, buying a house, or starting a business could be those who would seek this type of model.@-1/&0/Cash and cash equivalents, such as money markets, treasuries, and commercial paper, often compose upward of 80% of these portfolios. The biggest danger is that the return earned might not keep pace with inflation, which could erode purchasing power in real terms.@@@

TextPage¤Income@-1/&0/Portfolios that are designed to generate income for their owners often consist of investment-grade, fixed-income obligations of large, profitable corporations; real estate (in the form of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs); Treasury notes; and, to a lesser extent, shares of blue-chip companies with long histories of dividend payments.@-1/&0/Income-oriented investors may be nearing retirement. Or they may be a single parent with small children; they might be receiving a lump-sum settlement from their partner's life insurance policy and can't risk losing the principal.@-1/&0/While growth would be nice, the need for cash in hand for living expenses is most important.@@@

TextPage¤Balanced Portfolio@-1/&0/Halfway between the income and growth models is a compromise known as the 'balanced portfolio'. Portfolios based on this model attempt to strike a balance between long-term growth and current income.@-1/&0/The ideal result is a mix of assets that generate cash; at the same time, the goal is for these assets to appreciate over time with smaller fluctuations in quoted principal value than the all-growth portfolio.@-1/&0/Balanced portfolios tend to divide assets between medium-term investment-grade fixed-income obligations and shares of common stocks in leading corporations; many of these may pay cash dividends.@@@

TextPage¤Growth@-1/&0/The growth asset-allocation model is designed for those who are interested in building long-term wealth. The assets are not required to generate current income; the owner is employed and living off their salary. @-1/&0/Unlike with an income portfolio, the investor is likely to increase their position each year by adding funds. @-1/&0/In bull markets, growth portfolios tend to outperform their counterparts significantly; in bear markets, they are the hardest hit.@@@
