ListPage¤Four Model Types@-1/&0/Most asset-allocation models fall somewhere among four objectives:@2&Preservation of Capital/Income Generation/Balanced/Growth@@@
TextPage¤Preservation of Capital@-1/&0/Asset-allocation models designed for the preservation of capital are largely for those who expect to use their cash within the next 12 months.@-1/&0/They often do not wish to risk losing even a small percentage of principal value for the possibility of capital gains.#Those who plan on paying for college, buying a house, or starting a business could be those who would seek this type of model.#Cash and cash equivalents, such as money markets, treasuries, and commercial paper, often compose upward of 80% of these portfolios.#The biggest danger is that the return earned might not keep pace with inflation, which could erode purchasing power in real terms.@@@

TextPage¤Income@-1/&0/Portfolios that are designed to generate income for their owners often consist of investment-grade, fixed-income obligations of large, profitable corporations; real estate (in the form of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs); Treasury notes; and, to a lesser extent, shares of blue-chip companies with long histories of dividend payments.@-1/&0/Income-oriented investors may be nearing retirement. Or they may be a single parent with small children; they might be receiving a lump-sum settlement from their partner's life insurance policy and can't risk losing the principal.#While growth would be nice, the need for cash in hand for living expenses is most important.@@@

TextPage¤Balanced Portfolio@-1/&0/Halfway between the income and growth models is a compromise known as the "balanced portfolio."#Portfolios based on this model attempt to strike a balance between long-term growth and current income.@-1/&0/The ideal result is a mix of assets that generate cash; at the same time, the goal is for these assets to appreciate over time with smaller fluctuations in quoted principal value than the all-growth portfolio.@-1/&0/Balanced portfolios tend to divide assets between medium-term investment-grade fixed-income obligations and shares of common stocks in leading corporations; many of these may pay cash dividends.@@@

TextPage¤Growth@-1/&0/The growth asset-allocation model is designed for those who are interested in building long-term wealth. @-1/&0/The assets are not required to generate current income; the owner is employed and living off their salary. @-1/&0/Unlike with an income portfolio, the investor is likely to increase their position each year by adding funds. # In bull markets, growth portfolios tend to outperform their counterparts significantly; in bear markets, they are the hardest hit.@@@
