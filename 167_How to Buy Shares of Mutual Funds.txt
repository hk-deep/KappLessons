ListPage¤How to Buy Shares of Mutual Funds@-1/&0/Once you are ready to begin investing in mutual funds, you have to go about buying your mutual fund shares.@-1/&0/There are three main ways this is done. You have the option to purchase through :@2&a broker/a mutual fund company/or a retirement plan.@@@
TextPage¤Through Your Broker@-1/&0/If you have a brokerage account you can buy most mutual funds just like you would stocks. @-1/&0/In some cases, you may be charged a commission or a flat fee for the purchase. Such a charge is called a load. @-1/&0/There are so many funds available that don't charge a load, you should really try to do your own research and find the right no-load fund for your current investment need.@@@
TextPage¤Directly From a Mutual Fund Company@-1/&0/If you know you want to have your money invested in a specific mutual fund or in mutual funds that make up part of a larger mutual fund family, you can often open an account directly with the mutual fund itself. @-1/&0/The biggest advantage to buying fund shares directly from the mutual fund company itself is that you're unlikely to get charged a commission or fee, meaning more money goes into your investments and is working for you. @-1/&0/A downside of buying shares directly from the mutual fund company is that it can be more difficult to transfer your holdings later or diversify into additional securities, including shares of mutual funds offered by other financial institutions.@@@
TextPage¤Through a Retirement Plan@-1/&0/If you work at a company with more than a few dozen employees, you probably can sock away money in a work retirement plan. In almost all cases, the main investment options will be mutual funds. @-1/&0/A downside of this approach is that you are likely to have only a limited menu of potential mutual fund investments, some of which may be subpar. # Nevertheless, if your employer matches a percentage of the money you invest from your paycheck, an employer retirement plan is often a wise investment option to take advantage of.@@@
