ListPage¤Examples of Financial Markets@-1/&0/Financial Markets are broad in scope and scale. Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market, the bond market, forex, commodities, and the real estate market, among others:@2&Stock Markets/Bond Markets/Money Markets/Forex Market/Commodities Markets/Derivatives Markets/Cryptocurrency Markets@-1/&0/@@@
ImagePage¤Stock Markets@-1/&0/Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are venues where companies list their shares, which are bought and sold by traders and investors. @0@-1/&0/Stock markets, or equities markets, are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns.@@@
ImagePage¤Stock Markets@-1/&0/Stocks may be traded on listed exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, or the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Most stock trading is done via regulated exchanges though.@1@-1/&0/Typical participants in a stock market include (both retail and institutional) investors, traders, market makers (MMs), and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide two-sided markets. Brokers are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock.@@@
TextPage¤Bond Markets@-1/&0/A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. You may think of a bond as an agreement between the lender and borrower containing the loan's details and its payments. @-1/&0/Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. For example, the bond market sells securities such as notes and bills issued by the United States Treasury. @-1/&0/The bond market is also called the debt, credit, or fixed-income market.@@@
TextPage¤Money Markets@-1/&0/Typically, the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities (less than one year) and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets. @-1/&0/At the wholesale level, the money markets involve large-volume trades between institutions and traders. # At the retail level, they include money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers. @-1/&0/Individuals may also invest in the money markets by purchasing short-term certificates of deposit (CDs), municipal notes, or U.S. Treasury bills, among other examples.@@@
TextPage¤Forex Market@-1/&0/The forex (foreign exchange) market is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs. @-1/&0/The forex market is the most liquid market in the world, as cash is the most liquid of assets. The currency market handles more than $7.5 trillion in daily transactions, more than the futures and equity markets combined. @-1/&0/As with the OTC markets, the forex market is also decentralized and consists of a global network of computers and brokers worldwide. @@@
ListPage¤Commodities Markets@-1/&0/Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as :@2&Agricultural products (e.g., corn, livestock, soybeans)/Energy products (oil, gas, carbon credits)/Precious metals (gold, silver, platinum)/"Soft" commodities (such as cotton, coffee, and sugar)@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Commodities Markets@-1/&0/These are known as spot commodity markets, where physical goods are exchanged for money. @-1/&0/However, the bulk of trading in these commodities takes place on derivatives markets that utilize spot commodities as the underlying assets. # Forwards, futures, and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed exchanges around the world, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).@@@
TextPage¤Derivatives Markets@-1/&0/A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). @-1/&0/Rather than trading stocks directly, a derivatives market trades in futures and options contracts and other advanced financial products that derive their value from underlying instruments like bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks.@-1/&0/The main types of derivatives are options (puts and calls), forwards, futures and swap.@@@
TextPage¤Derivatives Markets@-1/&0/Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded. Unlike forwards, which trade OTC, futures markets utilize standardized contract specifications, are well-regulated, and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades. @-1/&0/Options markets, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), similarly list and regulate options contracts. @-1/&0/Both futures and options exchanges may list contracts on various asset classes, such as equities, fixed-income securities, commodities, and so on.@@@
TextPage¤Cryptocurrency Markets@-1/&0/Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges. These exchanges host digital wallets for traders to swap one cryptocurrency for another or for fiat monies such as dollars or euros. @-1/&0/Because most crypto exchanges are centralized platforms, users are susceptible to hacks or fraudulent activity. #Decentralized exchanges are also available that operate without any central authority. These exchanges allow direct peer-to-peer (P2P) trading without an actual exchange authority to facilitate the transactions. @-1/&0/Futures and options trading are also available on major cryptocurrencies.@@@
