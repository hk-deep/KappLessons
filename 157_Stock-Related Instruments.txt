ListPage¤Stock-Related Instruments@-1/&0/In addition to the two main types of stocks, namely common stocks and preferred stocks, some companies issue other types of instruments that allow them to diversify their sources of funding on one hand, and on the other hand to satisfy investors' appetite for risk diversification. They also use these instruments to sweeten or facilitate equity issues:@2&Convertible Bonds/Rights/Warrants@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Convertible Bonds@-1/&0/Convertible bonds are forms of long-term debt issued by publicly traded companies. Like bonds, convertibles are sold in predetermined amounts with fixed interest or coupon rates and maturity dates, although the rates tend to be lower than those of traditional bonds.@-1/&0/To make up the interest difference between convertible debentures and bonds, convertible bonds can be converted into shares of stock after a specific period of time.@-1/&0/The convertible nature of convertible bonds gives investors a sense of security in knowing that their investments can be converted into shares of the company, leading to a higher level of liquidity and the option for a faster exit should things start to go south.@@@
TextPage¤Rights@-1/&0/Rights, or rights issues, give existing shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount to the current trading price at a future date.#Rights are often included in fundraising transactions. For example, company XYZ may need to raise $5 million. To do so, XYZ issues shares equal to $5.5 million, discounting the initial purchase to drive institutional interest.@-1/&0/However, these shares may be sold as units that include rights to purchase additional shares at or near the price of the offering. Once the maturity date of these rights comes to fruition, investors can exercise their right to purchase newly issued shares or decide not to.@-1/&0/This would mean a significant extra gain for rights holders if XYZ’s stock soars — they can buy more shares of the stock at or near the original offering price.@@@
TextPage¤Warrants@-1/&0/Rights and warrants are very similar. Both are commonly used to sweeten the pot in fundraising transactions, and both give the investor the right to purchase shares at a discounted price.@-1/&0/The difference between the two is the time frame during which transactions can take place.# Whereas rights give investors the opportunity to purchase shares at a discounted price on or after a predetermined date, warrants give investors the opportunity to purchase shares at a discounted price up to a predetermined date.@-1/&0/If the investor fails to purchase the discounted shares by the expiration date on the warrant, they give up the right to purchase these shares.@@@
