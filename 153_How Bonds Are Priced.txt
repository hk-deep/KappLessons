TextPage¤How Bonds Are Priced@-1/&0/Bond valuation is done by calculating the present value of a bond's future interest payments, also known as its cash flow, and the bond's value upon maturity, also known as its redemption value. @-1/&0/The theoretical fair value of a bond is calculated by discounting the future value of its coupon payments by an appropriate discount rate.# The discount rate used is the yield to maturity, which is the rate of return that an investor will get if they reinvested every coupon payment from the bond at a fixed interest rate until the bond matures.# It takes into account the price of a bond, par value, coupon rate, and time to maturity. @-1/&0/Because a bond's par value and interest payments are fixed, an investor uses bond valuation to determine what rate of return is required for a bond investment to be worthwhile.@@@
ImagePage¤Bond Valuation Formula@-1/&0/Calculating the value of a coupon bond factors in the annual or semi-annual coupon payment and the par value of the bond. @0@-1/&0/The present value of expected cash flows is added to the present value of the face value of the bond as seen in the following formula: @0@-1/&0/@FORMULA@@@
TextPage¤Bond Prices and Interest Rates@-1/&0/This formula also explains why a bond’s price varies inversely with interest rates works.# When interest rates go up, bond prices fall in order to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa. @-1/&0/Another way of illustrating this concept is to consider what the yield on our bond would be given a price change, instead of given an interest rate change.@@@
TextPage¤Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)@-1/&0/The yield-to-maturity (YTM) of a bond is another way of considering a bond’s price. YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime.@-1/&0/Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate.@-1/&0/In other words, it is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled.@@@
ImagePage¤Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)@-1/&0/YTM is a complex calculation but is quite useful as a concept for evaluating the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. @0@-1/&0/@FORMULA@@@
TextPage¤Bond Duration@-1/&0/We can also measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with a measure known as the duration of a bond.@-1/&0/Duration is expressed in units of the number of years since it originally referred to zero-coupon bonds, whose duration is its maturity.@-1/&0/For practical purposes, however, duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates.@@@
TextPage¤Bond Price Sensitivity@-1/&0/The duration can be calculated to determine the price sensitivity to interest rate changes of a single bond, or for a portfolio of many bonds.@-1/&0/In general, bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes.@-1/&0/A bond’s duration is not a linear risk measure, meaning that as prices and rates change, the duration itself changes, and convexity measures this relationship.@@@
TextPage¤Pricing Moves@-1/&0/Bonds trade at a premium when the current price is higher than the face value. Discount bonds are the opposite, selling for less than the listed face value.#The interest paid on bonds is fixed so bonds that are priced lower have higher yields. They're more attractive to investors.@-1/&0/In the secondary market, bond prices have an inverse relationship to interest rates, resulting in counterintuitive price movements when interest rates change. @-1/&0/When the Central Bnk raises interest rates, bondholders must accept lower prices to compete with new issuances. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the prices of existing bonds will tend to increase.@@@
