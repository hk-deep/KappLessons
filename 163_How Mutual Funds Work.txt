TextPage¤How Mutual Funds Work@-1/&0/Many investors wonder what is going on behind-the-scenes when they invest in a mutual fund. Much of the time, there is a board of directors or trustees that monitor the fund and make decisions based on shareholder interests. @-1/&0/There are many other agents involved in the management of a fund, such as accountants, auditors, and transfer agents. All of these entities receive payments for their roles in managing the fund. @-1/&0/Once you write a check to start investing, there is a process your funds follow. It is not absolutely necessary to understand all of the inner workings of mutual funds, but it helps to know how your money is handled. For beginners, this is an excellent look at how mutual funds are structured.@@@
TextPage¤History@-1/&0/A mutual fund takes money from a group of people and invests it in a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. This basket is known as a portfolio and represents a range of companies and sectors. @-1/&0/Mutual funds can be traced all the way back to 1774 when Dutch merchant Adriaan van Ketwich proposed a financial arrangement that involved pooling money from multiple investors to make investing available to the masses rather than a rich man's game alone. @-1/&0/Others date its origins to 1822 when King William I of the Netherlands was thought to have created the first closed-end investment company. However, the first modern mutual fund wasn't introduced until 1924.@@@
TextPage¤Objectives@-1/&0/Each mutual fund has a unique objective that the fund manager attempts to meet by following a specific management strategy. @-1/&0/It might invest in stocks from around the globe, a particular region or country, or stocks of companies that pay high dividends or have quickly growing revenues. @-1/&0/Its managers might also select stocks they believe are undervalued or bonds they believe are less prone to credit risk.@@@
TextPage¤Structure@-1/&0/No matter the goal of the fund, buying shares in a mutual fund is similar to buying shares in a publicly-traded company in that every share you buy of a mutual fund represents your partial ownership in the fund and the money it makes. @-1/&0/The key distinction is that with a mutual fund, you buy shares of a portfolio of company stock or other securities rather than the stock of a single company.@@@
TextPage¤Pass-through@-1/&0/A mutual fund is an open-end investment—that is, one that can issue and redeem shares whenever it wants. #After you buy shares in a mutual fund, you can sell them back to the fund—either directly or through a broker—for roughly the shares' net asset value (NAV). @-1/&0/Mutual fund investors don't actually own the underlying holdings—the stocks or bonds—that have been purchased by the fund. @-1/&0/Rather, they benefit from owning shares of the fund that owns those holdings whenever the values of the holdings increase.@@@
