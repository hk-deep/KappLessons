ListPage¤Diversification Strategies@-1/&0/As you consider ways to diversify your holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement.@2&Industries/Sectors/Growth vs. Value/Market Capitalizations/Foreign vs. Domestic/Maturities@-1/&0/Many of the methods above can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.@@@
TextPage¤Sectors@-1/&0/There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk. @-1/&0/You can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. @-1/&0/For example, consider two major means of entertainment: travel and digital streaming. If you want to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts you may invest in digital streaming platforms (positively impacted by more shutdowns). @-1/&0/At the same time, you may consider simultaneously investing in airlines (positively impacted by fewer shutdowns). In theory, these two unrelated industries may minimize overall portfolio risk.@@@
TextPage¤Corporate Lifecycle Stages@-1/&0/Public equities tend to be broken into two categories: growth stocks and value stocks. @-1/&0/Growth stocks tend to be more risky as the expected growth of a company may not materialize. However, they have more potential to generate greater returns. @-1/&0/On the other hand, value stocks tend to be more established, stable companies. While these companies may have already experienced most of their potential, they usually carry less risk. @-1/&0/By diversifying into both, you would capitalize on the future potential of some companies while also recognizing the existing benefits of others.@@@
TextPage¤Market Capitalizations@-1/&0/You may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlying market capitalization of the asset or company. @-1/&0/Lower cap stocks have more room to grow, though higher cap stocks tend to be safer investments. @-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Maturity Lengths@-1/&0/Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact risk profiles. @-1/&0/Generally, the longer the maturity, the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bond's prices due to changes in interest rates. @-1/&0/Short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates; however, they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. @-1/&0/You may consider diversifying your portfolio by adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest.@@@
TextPage¤Physical Locations@-1/&0/Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. @-1/&0/For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn. @-1/&0/Alternatively, there may be a greater potential upside (with associated higher degrees of risk) when diversifying across developed and emerging countries.@@@
