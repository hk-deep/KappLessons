TextPage¤Are Low-Cost Index Funds the Best Investment@-1/&0/Many professionals believe that low-cost index funds are a better investment choice for those who want to grow their wealth without a lot of hassle. @-1/&0/How are index funds different? Should you consider investing in them instead of actively managed mutual funds? # Index funds are mutual funds based on the performance of one of the notable indexes (e.g., the S&P 500). Indexes are measurements of the performance of a select group of funds, and the index funds are designed to mirror the index's performance. @-1/&0/Index investments can be good investments if they fit your style and needs.@@@
TextPage¤What is an Index Fund@-1/&0/An index, with regard to investing, is a sampling of securities that represent a defined segment of the market. @-1/&0/For example, the S&P 500 Index is a sampling of 500 large-capitalization stocks. # Index funds are simply mutual funds that invest in the same securities as its benchmark index.@@@
TextPage¤What is an Index Fund@-1/&0/When you purchase a share in one of these funds, you are actually buying a small piece of a number of stocks at once. @-1/&0/Index funds are passively managed. This means the fund manager picks an index to track and then simply copies its holdings. # They may check in when the index has changed its holdings, or some other major event, and rework the balance of your holdings. But for the most part your portfolio will stay as it is.@@@
TextPage¤Why use an Index Fund@-1/&0/The logic in using index funds is that, over time, the majority of active fund managers are not able to outperform the broad market indexes. @-1/&0/Therefore, rather than trying to "beat the market," it is wise to simply invest in it. # Index funds keep costs low, they do a good job of matching the index securities (called tracking error), and they use proper weighting methods.@@@
