ListPage¤Return Determinants@-1/&0/May I have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.#Same goes for investing : several factors influence investment returns, some of which you can choose, and these include :@1&Asset allocation/Diversification/Investment strategy@@@
ListPage¤Return Determinants@-1/&0/Some other you can’t control :@1&Market conditions/Economic growth/Inflation/Interest rates/Geopolitical events@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Asset allocation@-1/&0/When you allocate your money into various assets, you are averaging out the return of each asset in your portfolio. @-1/&0/Suppose your portfolio is composed of just 2 equally weighted assets A1 and A2.# Let’s say A1 has a return of 20% and A2 has a return of 4%. Your portfolio return for this year is 12%.@@@
TextPage¤Asset allocation@-1/&0/Not that bad, but had you chosen a different allocation, your return would have been different. For example, if A1’s weight was 75%, then the return of the portfolio would have been 16% (much better). @-1/&0/Now apply this reasoning to a much more diversified portfolio of dozens of instruments and the complexity of our very simple case and you see how important it is for the performance of your portfolio to choose the right asset allocation.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/Diversification is spreading investments across various asset classes, reducing the impact of any single asset's poor performance.@-1/&0/By holding a mix of assets—such as stocks, bonds, and real estate—you can mitigate risk and enhance the potential for stable returns. @-1/&0/ In our previous example, the idea of diversification is to choose assets A1 and A2 in different classes, ideally with a low correlation between them, and hence make their returns independent of each other.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification@-1/&0/This helps balance the portfolio, smoothing out fluctuations and improving risk-adjusted returns over time. @-1/&0/Ultimately, a well-diversified portfolio is more resilient to market volatility, contributing to more consistent and reliable investment performance.@@@
ListPage¤Investment strategy@-1/&0/Would you go to battle without a plan? Of course not. Same goes for investing.@1&Your investment strategy, whether aggressive or conservative, determines the return of your portfolio by guiding how you allocate your assets, choose investments, and manage risk./Choosing a strategy is basically deciding:/how to distribute your investments among different asset classes/which specific securities or investments within each asset class/the level of risk you're willing to take, and how you’ll manage it/how long you’re aiming for, and how often you’ll be shuffling your portfolio/your approach to investing, whether it's value, growth or income investing, or a combination@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Investment strategy@-1/&0/It balances high-risk high-reward investments with safer, lower-yield options, optimizing potential returns while managing risk. @-1/&0/It also influences the timing of buying and selling assets, impacting the gains or losses you realize. @-1/&0/More importantly, by sticking to a strategy, you can avoid impulsive decisions and take advantage of market opportunities, ultimately shaping the overall performance and return of your portfolio.@@@
TextPage¤Market conditions@-1/&0/Market conditions, such as economic growth, interest rates, and geopolitical events, directly influence the return of your investment portfolio. @-1/&0/During periods of boom, stocks and other high-risk assets typically perform well, boosting portfolio returns. # Conversely, in times of uncertainty, these assets may decline, affecting overall returns.@@@
TextPage¤Market conditions@-1/&0/Commodities and forex may also influence your portfolio both directly (if you hold some) and indirectly (by affecting the value of other assets, like stocks of companies that heavily depend on them for their production or imports for example). @-1/&0/Changes in interest rates impact the performance of bonds and other fixed-income investments, but also the valuation of stocks, further affecting your portfolio returns.@@@
TextPage¤Economic growth@-1/&0/Economic growth significantly impacts the return of your investment portfolio. @-1/&0/When the economy is expanding, businesses tend to perform better, leading to higher stock prices and increased portfolio returns. # On the other hand, during periods of slow growth or recession, company earnings may suffer, causing stock prices to fall and reducing returns. @-1/&0/Additionally, economic growth influences interest rates and inflation.@@@
TextPage¤Inflation@-1/&0/Inflation directly affects the return of your investment portfolio because when inflation is high, the purchasing power of your investment returns decreases, meaning your money buys less than it did before. @-1/&0/Bonds and cash (and cash equivalents) will particularly suffer from high inflation. @-1/&0/Certain assets, like stocks and real estate, might provide a hedge against inflation by appreciating in value. Commodities might also provide a hedge to a lesser extent.@@@
TextPage¤Interest rates@-1/&0/Interest rates have a similar effect. @-1/&0/When interest rates rise, bond prices typically fall, leading to lower returns on bond investments. Conversely, higher interest rates can benefit savings accounts and other cash-equivalent investments by offering higher yields. @-1/&0/For stocks, rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs for companies and reduce consumer spending, potentially lowering stock prices.@@@
TextPage¤Geopolitical events@-1/&0/Geopolitical events such as political instability, wars, or trade tensions, can create market volatility and uncertainty. These events can lead to fluctuations in stock and bond prices, impacting your portfolio's overall performance.@-1/&0/Investors often seek safer assets, such as gold or government bonds, during geopolitical crises, which can affect the performance of different asset classes. @-1/&0/You should also put most of your money in regions where you understand the political systems in place.@@@
