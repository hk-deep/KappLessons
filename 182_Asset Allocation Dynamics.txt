TextPage¤Asset Allocation Dynamics@-1/&0/As mentioned above, your ideal asset allocation will change with your needs as you move through the various stages of life, so you will be switching smoothly from one model to another while you advance in life. @-1/&0/In general, the younger you are, the higher the percentage of equities you should own. That is because you have a longer investment period in which to make up losses if they occur, and the stock market has generally trended upward over time. @-1/&0/More seasoned investors might have a higher percentage of fixed income holdings and might be more reliant on regular income than on big stock gains.@@@
TextPage¤Equity Glide Path@-1/&0/An equity glide path refers to the changes to the equity portion of your asset allocation as you age. @-1/&0/You can use such a path to build and maintain a retirement portfolio that achieves the optimal balance between risk and reward. @-1/&0/The right glide path depends on the time you have to invest, how much risk you can take, and your retirement goals.@@@
TextPage¤How Does an Equity Glide Path Work@-1/&0/Suppose you're 25 years old and want to retire at 65. Because the time until you retire is 40 years, your investments can weather the downturns and decline in value from an allocation that comes with more risk. @-1/&0/As you steer away from more risk as you age, you opt for a declining equity glide path, which means you reduce the portion of risky assets in your portfolio each year in order to achieve a target allocation at age 65.@@@
ImagePage¤Glide Path Formula@-1/&0/One classic glide path formula is: @0@-1/&0/It’s a rule of thumb commonly found in every advisor pitchbook, and has as such no scientific ground whatsoever.#We prefer another simple formula.@@@
ImagePage¤Glide Path Formula@-1/&0/In the previous example you are 25 and your risk appetite tells you to put 80% of your portfolio into equities, either in the form of funds (mutual funds or ETFs) or stocks directly. That’s your current allocation. #When you’re 65, you think you want to have no more than 20% (target allocation) of your portfolio in equities. #At any point in time between now and your retirement, you should keep your equities allocation at: @0@-1/&0/@@@
