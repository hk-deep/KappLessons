TextPage¤Mutual Fund Share Classes@-1/&0/Each mutual fund has a share class, which is basically a classification of how the fund charges fees. @-1/&0/There are several different types of mutual fund share classes, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, most of which center upon expenses. # These are usually designated by letters ranging from A to D. @-1/&0/Learn more about these share classes to find which suits you best.@@@
TextPage¤Class A shares@-1/&0/Class A share funds are also called "front load" funds because their fees are charged on "the front" when the investor first buys shares of the fund. @-1/&0/The loads typically range from 3% to 5%. A shares are best for investors who are using a broker and who plan to invest larger dollar amounts and will buy shares infrequently. # If the purchase amount is high enough, investors may qualify for "breakpoint discounts."@@@
TextPage¤Class B shares@-1/&0/Class B share funds are a share class of mutual funds that do not carry front-end sales charges, but instead, charge a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) or "back-end load." @-1/&0/Class B shares also tend to have higher fees than other mutual fund share classes. # For example, if an investor purchases mutual fund Class B shares, they will not be charged a front-end load but will instead pay a back-end load if the investor sells shares prior to a stated period to redeem their shares. @-1/&0/Class B shares can eventually exchange into Class A shares after seven or eight years. Therefore, they may be best for investors who do not have enough to invest to qualify for a break level on the A share but intend to hold the B shares for several years or more.@@@
TextPage¤Class C shares@-1/&0/Class C share funds charge a "level load" annually, which is usually (but not always) around 1.00%. @-1/&0/This expense never goes away, making C share mutual funds the most expensive for investors who are investing for long periods of time. # Investors should use C shares for the short term (less than three years).@@@
TextPage¤Class D shares@-1/&0/Class D share funds are often similar to no-load funds in that they are a mutual fund share class that was created as an alternative to the traditional and more common A share, B share, and C share funds that are either front-loaded, back-loaded, or level-loaded, respectively. @-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Class Adv shares@-1/&0/Class Adv share funds are only available through an investment advisor, hence the abbreviation "Adv." These funds are typically no-load (or what is called "load-waived") but can have running fees up to 0.50%. @-1/&0/If you are working with an investment advisor or another financial professional, the Adv shares can be your best option, because the expenses are often lower.@@@
TextPage¤Institutional shares@-1/&0/Class Inst share funds (aka Class I, Class X, or Class Y) are generally only available to institutional investors with minimum investment amounts of $25,000 or more.@@@
TextPage¤LW shares@-1/&0/Load-Waived Funds are mutual fund share class alternatives to loaded funds, such as A share class funds. @-1/&0/As the name suggests, the mutual fund load is waived (not charged). @-1/&0/Typically, these funds are offered in retirement plans where loaded funds are not an option. @-1/&0/Load-waived mutual funds are often identified by an "LW" at the end of the fund name and at the end of the ticker symbol.@@@
TextPage¤R shares@-1/&0/Class R share funds do not have a load (i.e., a front-end load, back-end load, or level load), but they do have distribution fees that typically range from 0.25% to 0.50%. @-1/&0/If your retirement plan only provides R share class funds, your expenses may be higher than if the investment choices included the no-load (or load-waived) version of the same fund.@@@
