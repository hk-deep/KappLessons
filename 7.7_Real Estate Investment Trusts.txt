TextPage¤What is a Real Estate Investment Trust ?@-1/&0/Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate across different property sectors, allowing you to earn income without owning or managing properties yourself. @-1/&0/Designed to make real estate investing accessible, REITs let smaller investors buy into large real estate portfolios like shopping malls or skyscrapers, similar to how one would purchase stocks.# Publicly traded REITs trade on exchanges and can be bought and sold like stocks. When you buy shares of a REIT, you become a partial owner of the properties the REIT holds, much like owning stock in a company.@@@
TextPage¤How REITs Work?@-1/&0/A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) raises funds from numerous individual investors to create and manage a portfolio of real estate investments, which can include purchasing properties for leasing or investing in financial assets like mortgages. @-1/&0/The REIT generates income by collecting rent from tenants or receiving mortgage payments and typically distributes its earnings to shareholders as dividends.# Operating similarly to mutual funds, REITs allow investors to earn returns through both dividends and potential increases in the value of their shares.@@@
TextPage¤How REITs Work?@-1/&0/REITs make illiquid assets like real estate more accessible and liquid for investors, as they invest in a diverse range of properties, including apartment complexes, healthcare facilities, and office buildings. @-1/&0/While many REITs specialize in specific sectors, such as commercial real estate, others maintain diversified portfolios across various property types.# Due to their emphasis on providing relatively high dividends, REITs attract investors looking for consistent income. However, it's crucial to understand that these dividends are not guaranteed and can be reduced at the discretion of the REIT.@@@
ListPage¤Types of REITs@-1/&0/While REITs are categorized by the different kinds of properties they invest in, there have traditionally been three major types:@1&Equity REITs: 95% of REITs are equity-based and own and manage income-producing real estate. Revenues are generated primarily through rent./Mortgage REITs: these REITs lend money to real estate owners and operators directly through mortgages and loans or indirectly through acquiring mortgage-backed securities. Their earnings are generated primarily by the net interest margin./Hybrid REITs: These vehicles mix strategies from both equity and mortgage REITs, but they are very rare (less than 1% of existing REITs).@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Investing in REITs@-1/&0/Within the above types are REITs that have different ways of attracting funding:@1&Publicly traded REITs: Shares of publicly traded REITs are listed on a public exchange, where they are bought and sold by individual investors./Public non-traded REITs: These REITs are registered with the regulator but don’t trade on exchanges. As a result, they are less liquid than publicly traded REITs. Their shares can be bought through a broker or financial advisor./Private REITs: These REITs aren’t registered and don’t trade on securities exchanges. In general, private REITs can be sold only to institutional investors.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Pros and Cons@-1/&0/Shares in REITs are easy to buy and sell since many are publicly traded. @-1/&0/They offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and provide stable cash flow, making them a good option for portfolio diversification and dividend-based income.# However, REITs have limited capital appreciation potential because they are required to pay 90% of their income to investors, leaving only 10% for reinvestment. @-1/&0/Additionally, REIT dividends are taxed as regular income, and some REITs come with high management and transaction fees.@@@
