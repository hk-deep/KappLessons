ListPage¤Investment Vehicle Characteristics@-1/&0/@-1/&0/Investment vehicles have characteristics that can help investors decide which vehicles are the best fit for their portfolios.@-1/&0/Here are the most important attributes when evaluating investing vehicles:@-1/&0/@-1/&0/1. Expected return@-1/&0/2. Risk@-1/&0/3. [Liquidity](https://moneyfortherestofus.com/glossary/liquidity/)@-1/&0/4. Cost@-1/&0/5. Structure@-1/&0/6. Pricing@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Expected Returns@-1/&0/@-1/&0/An investment vehicle’s expected return is a realistic assumption of how much the investor could earn holding the investment over an intermediate-to-longer-term period.@-1/&0/The expected return is primarily driven by direct investments—those held by the investor directly or within an indirect investment vehicle such as a mutual fund.@-1/&0/@-1/&0/For most investments, the expected return is a function of three components:@-1/&0/1. The investment’s cash flow in the form of dividends, interest, or rents.@-1/&0/2. How much the cash flow is expected to grow over time.@-1/&0/3. What are investors paying for the cash flow now versus in the future.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Risk@-1/&0/An investment vehicle’s risk measures how much an investor could potentially lose if the investment falls short of the expected return.# The worst-case historical or expected loss for an investment vehicle is known as its maximum drawdown.@-1/&0/Risk is also measured by volatility.# Volatility reflects how much the investment deviates from the expected return.@-1/&0/A more volatile investment will have wider performance swings compared with a less volatile investment.# That means volatile investments can suffer greater losses than investments with lower volatility.# A less volatile investment will see most of its annual returns congregate around the expected return.# A volatile investment will see more returns well above or well below the expected return compared with a less volatile investment.@@@
TextPage¤Liquidity@-1/&0/Liquidity measures how quickly and easily an investor can buy or sell an asset.# An investment is more liquid if there is a large pool of willing buyers and sellers, as well as a place where those buyers and sellers can transact.@-1/&0/More liquid investments have higher trading volumes, so investors can be confident that prices are up-to-date and not stale.@-1/&0/Illiquid investments have fewer buyers and sellers.# The lack of buyers and sellers and the infrequency of transactions may require sellers to take a lower price than they would like and while buyers will have to pay more than they would like.# Public investment vehicles are typically more liquid than private investment vehicles because public investments have more buyers and sellers and a centralized place to transact.@@@
TextPage¤Costs@-1/&0/Cost measures how much you have to pay to buy, sell, and hold an investment vehicle.# Costs include commissions to enter and exit an investment as well as the fees paid to the vehicle sponsor to manage the investment.@-1/&0/Investment vehicle costs also include taxes on income and capital gains.# Direct investments have the lowest cost because there is no sponsor involved in selecting investments.@-1/&0/Indirect private investment vehicles, such as hedge funds and venture capital partnerships, have the highest costs because the underlying investments are complex and take a great deal of day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management team.# Consequently, private investment vehicles typically have high asset management fees.@@@
TextPage¤Costs@-1/&0/Public, indirect investment vehicles, index mutual funds, and ETFs have the lowest costs.# That’s because managing these investment vehicles requires less day-to-day research to select direct investments, and there is less trading in the underlying holdings.@-1/&0/Index funds and ETFs are also more tax-efficient because there are less frequent sales of the underlying holdings that could generate capital gains.@-1/&0/Actively managed open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds are the public indirect investment vehicles with the highest costs.# The management fees are higher to compensate the portfolio management team for the additional work in selecting direct investments.# Trading costs are also higher for actively managed funds because there is more trading.@@@
TextPage¤Structure@-1/&0/An investment vehicle’s structure refers to how it is organized and accessed by investors.# Structure includes a number of the attributes already covered in this article, such as whether the vehicle is direct, indirect, public, or private.@-1/&0/Structure also consists of the investment vehicle’s liquidity terms, costs, and whether the investment vehicle uses leverage.# Leverage means borrowing money to invest in assets in order to increase the potential return.@@@
TextPage¤Structure@-1/&0/Additional considerations when researching the structure of an investment vehicle is whether there is an account minimum and how the vehicle is taxed.# Investment vehicles have offering documents that describe the opportunity’s terms and structure.@-1/&0/Public investment vehicles have a prospectus, while private vehicles have an offering memorandum.# You should study these documents closely in order to understand the vehicle’s structure.@@@
TextPage¤Pricing@-1/&0/A final attribute to consider when evaluating an investment vehicle is how its market price is set.# Some investment vehicles’ market prices are determined by trades on an exchange in what is known as the secondary market.@-1/&0/Stocks, ETFs, and closed-end funds are examples of investment vehicles where the market price is set by trades in the secondary market.# The price of other indirect investment vehicles is set by the sponsor based on the value of the underlying holdings.# An open-end mutual fund is an example of this type of investment vehicle.@@@
TextPage¤Pricing@-1/&0/At the end of each trading day, the mutual fund sponsor determines the fund’s net asset value per share.# The net asset value (NAV) is calculated by taking the market price of a fund’s assets, including cash, subtracting any liabilities, and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.@-1/&0/Mutual fund sponsors set the market price per share equal to the NAV.# The fund sponsor then creates and redeems shares at the market price.# Indirect investment vehicles such as ETFs and closed-end funds whose market prices are set in the secondary market will often see those prices differ from the net value. @-1/&0/The ETF or closed-end fund can sell at a discount or premium to the NAV.@@@
