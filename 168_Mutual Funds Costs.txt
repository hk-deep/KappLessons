TextPage¤Mutual Funds Costs@-1/&0/When you buy your first mutual fund, you may encounter something known as a sales load. @-1/&0/There are front-end loads, back-end loads, deferred loads, and declining loads. # Loads are a type of commission. If you are not fully aware of the load(s) your chosen fund has, you can potentially lose money. @-1/&0/While this may sound complicated, it is very important that you understand what these terms mean. This is because buying the wrong type of mutual fund can take thousands of dollars directly out of your pocket in the form of commission payments.@@@
TextPage¤Expense Ratio@-1/&0/Even if the investor uses a no-load fund, there are underlying expenses that are indirect charges for use in the fund's operation. @-1/&0/The expense ratio is the percentage of fees paid to the mutual fund company to manage and operate the fund, including all administrative expenses and distribution fees. # The mutual fund company would take those expenses out of the fund prior to the investor seeing the return.@@@
TextPage¤Expense Ratio@-1/&0/For example, if the expense ratio of a mutual fund were 1.00%, and you were to invest $10,000, the expense for a given year would be $100. @-1/&0/However, the expense is not taken directly out of your pocket. The expense effectively reduces the gross return of the fund. # Put differently, if the fund earns 10%, before expenses, in a given year, the investor would see a net return of 9.00% (10.00% - 1.00%).@@@
ListPage¤Mutual Fund Loads@-1/&0/Loads are fees charged to the investor when buying or selling certain types of mutual funds.@2&Front-end loads are charged up front (at the time of purchase) and average around 5% but can be as high as 8.5%. For example, if you invest $1,000 with a 5% front load, the load amount will be $50.00, and therefore your initial investment will actually be $950./Back-end loads, also called "contingent deferred sales charges," are charged only when you sell a back-loaded fund. These charges can also be 5% or more, but the load amount typically declines over time and can be reduced to zero after a certain number of years.@@@
TextPage¤Mutual Fund Loads@-1/&0/Load-waived funds are funds that normally charge a load but waive it if there is some qualifying circumstance, such as purchases made within a retirement plan. @-1/&0/No-load funds do not charge any loads. These are the best type of fund to use, because minimizing fees helps to maximize returns. # When researching mutual funds, you can identify the load types by the letter A or B at the end of the fund name. Share class A funds are front-loaded funds, and share class B are back-loaded funds. @-1/&0/Sometimes, the load-waived funds have the letters LW at the end of the fund name. Once again, be sure to look for no-load funds.@@@
