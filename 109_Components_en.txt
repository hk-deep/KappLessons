ListPage¤Components@-1/&0/@1&Select Investment Vehicles/Establish Risk Management Strategies/Check Liquidity Needs/Ensure Tax Efficiency/Make some Contingency Plans/Monitor and Review@-1/&0/Don’t worry, these are not carved in stone, you can change them anytime. But it’s important to write them down as a reminder and to ensure consistency.@@@
TextPage¤Financial Goals@-1/&0/There’s a saying: No one is going anywhere without a goal. The same goes for financial goals. @-1/&0/Your financial goals provide a clear roadmap for your investment strategy. Whether you are saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, or your child's education, knowing your objectives helps you determine the types of investments that will best support your goals.# You should set SMART goals, write them down, then classify and prioritize them.@@@
ListPage¤Financial Goals@-1/&0/SMART means :@1&Specific: Your goals need to be clear and specific in order to achieve them./Measurable: Your goals should be clear enough that you can measure your progress towards them./Achievable: They should be set such that you should be able to figure out ways of achieving them./Relevant: this one is about evaluating how this goal fits into your overall financial planning./Time-related: Nothing focuses the mind like a deadline. That’s as true of finances as anything else.@-1/&0/Kapp will help you that with our dedicated tool@@@
TextPage¤Time Horizon@-1/&0/You’ll then have to put a time tag on each and every one of these goals. @-1/&0/Short-term goals might need safer, more liquid investments, while long-term goals can handle more risk for potentially higher returns.# You need to do that to plan properly and stay focused on your objectives.@-1/&0/This also ensures you have the right funds available when needed.@@@
TextPage¤Risk Tolerance Assessment@-1/&0/To assess your risk tolerance you need to take a quick questionnaire (see below). @-1/&0/Although this is not a scientific ultra-precise calculation (if ever such a test exists), it will nonetheless give you a quite good idea of where you stand when it comes to handling uncertainty.@-1/&0/ It is important to do that because it will help you determine the types of investments suitable for you and ensure your investment strategy aligns with your comfort level and financial capacity, minimizing stress and preventing panic selling during market downturns.@@@
ListPage¤Asset Allocation@-1/&0/Once you’ve assessed your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon, you’ll have to choose an asset allocation.#This will be done in two steps :@1&Allocate your wealth between the 3 buckets (which we’ll cover in chapter 4)/For each bucket decide on the proportion of your portfolio to allocate to each asset class, such as equities, bonds, and cash equivalents, based on these factors.@-1/&0/Finally, diversify within each asset class to further mitigate risk, and regularly review and adjust your allocation to stay aligned with your objectives and changing market conditions.@@@
TextPage¤Diversification Strategy@-1/&0/To choose a diversification strategy, begin by understanding the different asset classes available, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. @-1/&0/With your risk tolerance and investment goals in mind, determine the appropriate mix of these assets.# Consider spreading investments across different sectors, industries, and geographical regions to reduce concentration risk.@-1/&0/More importantly, you’ll decide whether you’ll take the hands-off way (a fund) or a DIY approach, and if you have enough time to compose your own portfolio or buy ready-made diversified ETFs.@@@
TextPage¤Investment Selection Criteria@-1/&0/Once you’ve defined your financial goals and risk tolerance, choose how you’ll select the most suitable investment. @-1/&0/These criteria might include investment volatility, liquidity, availability, potential return, and so on.# They’ll also include complexity and the time you need to monitor and maintain your portfolio.@-1/&0/Make sure your criteria align with your overall investment strategy and regularly review and adjust them based on market conditions and personal circumstances.@@@
TextPage¤Investment Vehicles@-1/&0/Applying these criteria, select the asset classes, and within these, the specific financial instruments, that best fit your needs. @-1/&0/We’ll go through these in more detail and help you wrap your head around them, but bear in mind that the best way to start is to keep it simple.@-1/&0/ In Chapter 7, we propose a very simple and effective strategy to start, which you can then improve and enhance at will.@@@
TextPage¤Risk Management Strategies@-1/&0/Risk management strategies involve deciding in advance (and we insist on that) what you’ll do when things go wrong (and they will at some point). @-1/&0/Where is your pain point? 10%? 20%? More? # What will you do then? Cut? Wait? Reinvest? Panic?@-1/&0/You can’t wait to see it happen to decide on a strategy because you’ll then be subject to an emotional roller coaster that will cloud your judgment.@@@
TextPage¤Liquidity Needs@-1/&0/When setting an investment plan, consider your liquidity needs by assessing how quickly and easily you may need to access funds. @-1/&0/Determine your short-term financial obligations such as emergency expenses, upcoming large purchases, or expected withdrawals.# Allocate a portion of your portfolio to liquid assets like cash equivalents or short-term investments to cover these needs.@-1/&0/Balance liquidity with longer-term investments that may offer higher returns but require a longer holding period. Regularly reassess your liquidity needs as they may change over time due to personal circumstances or economic conditions.@@@
TextPage¤Tax Efficiency@-1/&0/We hope you’ll pay some taxes, which would mean you’ve made money on your investments. But still, you’d want to minimize the taxes you pay on investment income and gains. @-1/&0/Start by understanding the tax implications of different types of investments—such as stocks, bonds, and real estate—along with any tax-advantaged accounts available to you, like IRAs or 401(k)s in the US (there are similar accounts in almost every country).@-1/&0/ Utilize tax-efficient investment strategies such as holding investments for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates or investing in municipal bonds for tax-free income, and maybe consult with a tax advisor to help you.@@@
TextPage¤Contingency Planning@-1/&0/Now you’ve planned everything, but you know, life has a funny way … and things went wrong. Imagine you took a 29 Black Monday in the face; no planning or asset allocation would save you. What would you do then? @-1/&0/Contingency planning is deciding how to make sure that in this case you’re at least safe for some time, long enough to find your way back. @-1/&0/ You can do this by safeguarding part (how much?) of your wealth in assets that won’t move. More on that in Chapters 4 and 5.@@@
TextPage¤Monitoring and Review@-1/&0/Keep in mind that the world keeps spinning and that nothing is permanent—neither the economy nor the market nor you for that matter. @-1/&0/So stay flexible: monitor your investments regularly and review your investment plan on a regular basis, and even the frequency of monitoring and review must be set in your investment plan (a bit “Inceptionny” if you think about it …)@-1/&0/ Now it’s time to start filling the blanks, and Kapp is here to help.@@@
