TextPage¤Risk Tolerance@-1/&0/Your risk tolerance guides the proportion of each asset class in your portfolio.@-1/&0/For example, if you have a high risk tolerance, you may allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to stocks, which have the potential for higher returns but also greater volatility.#Conversely, if you have a low risk tolerance, you may lean towards more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents.@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Time Horizon@-1/&0/Your time horizon refers to the length of time you plan to hold your investments before needing to access the funds.

TextPage¤Market Conditions@-1/&0/Market conditions encompass various factors, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment, that collectively influence the behavior of financial markets.@-1/&0/These conditions can range from periods of stability and growth to times of volatility and uncertainty.#In times of economic expansion and bullish sentiment, investors may be more inclined to allocate a higher proportion of their portfolio to riskier assets like stocks, aiming to capitalize on potential growth opportunities.@-1/&0/Conversely, during economic downturns or bear markets, investors may adopt a more defensive stance, favoring safer assets such as bonds or cash to protect against potential losses.@@@
