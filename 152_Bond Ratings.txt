TextPage¤Bond Ratings@-1/&0/Most bonds come with a rating that outlines their quality of credit—that is, how strong the bond is and its ability to pay its principal and interest. @-1/&0/A bond rating is a grade given by a rating agency that assesses the creditworthiness of the bond's issuer, signifying the likelihood of default.# Ratings are published and used by investors and professionals to judge their worthiness.@@@
TextPage¤Agencies@-1/&0/Major rating agencies like Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P) issue a credit rating for bonds. @-1/&0/Bond ratings represent the rating agencies' opinion of the issuer's creditworthiness and ability to repay its debt, based on its financial position, management, and other factors.# The ratings are the opinion of the agency. They are not a guarantee of credit quality, probability of default, or recommendation to buy or sell.# Ratings reflect a current assessment of an issuer's creditworthiness and do not guarantee performance now or in the future.# Issuers rated below investment grade are expected to have a greater risk than those with investment grade credit ratings.@@@
