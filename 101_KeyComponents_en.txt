ListPage¤Key Components of Investing@-1/&0/If you want to build a sound investment approach you need to consider the following :@2&Resources/Expectations/Time horizon/Returns/Risk/Allocation@-1/&0/Let's go into more details about these and how they interact.@@@
TextPage¤Key Components of Investing@-1/&0/For any game you play you need to first to know your strengths (resources) and state your objectives (Expectations and Time horizon).@-1/&0/You also need to understand the characteristics (Risk and Return) of the tools at your disposal, then organise them in the right way to achieve your goals (Allocation)#Simple as that.@@@
TextPage¤Resources@-1/&0/Financial resources are the money you have available to invest, and they are crucial for several reasons.@-1/&0/For a starter, you need money (obviously) to buy stocks, bonds, or other assets. But having more money also allows you to spread your investments across different assets, reducing risk.@-1/&0/ Besides, the amount available to you will also give you access to various investing strategies.  If you have $10k to invest, you won’t access the same products and instruments as if you had $10m at your disposal. For example, you’d need at least $1m to invest in a hedge fund or a private equity fund.@@@
TextPage¤Expectations@-1/&0/When it comes to investing, expectations shape your investment decisions, strategies, and outcomes. That’s why you need to manage your expectations.@-1/&0/Meaning that if you think you’re gonna crush the game on your first day of investing, you’re probably not setting them right.@@@
ListPage¤Expectations@-1/&0/Realistic expectations will help you:@1&set achievable goals (both in terms of returns and amount)/understand and control the risks you need to take/make informed decisions/focus on long-term growth rather than short-term gains/and avoid disappointment and stress when things don’t work out your way@-1/&0/So set them right, i.e. realistically, and maintain patience and discipline.@@@
ListPage¤Time horizon@-1/&0/We can’t stress enough the importance of your time horizon when investing, and the huge influence it has on your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and potential returns. @1&You won’t make the same investment choices with a long time horizon (where you can invest in assets like stocks, which have higher growth potential) than with a shorter time horizon which will require safer investments like bonds./Your attitude towards investment risk is also affected because the farther your time horizon, the more risk you can take, as there is more time to recover from market downturns.@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Time horizon@-1/&0/@1&Needless to say, your investment strategy should align with your financial goals and their respective time frames, such as saving for retirement versus buying a house in five years./Over time, the impact of market volatility lessens, making long-term investments generally more stable./This in turn leads to more peace of mind because knowing your time horizon reduces anxiety during market fluctuations./A clear time horizon helps you adjust your investment mix as your goals approach, shifting from growth-focused to preservation-focused assets for example.@-1/&0/Your time horizon can change with life events like career changes, marriage, or having children (then requiring adjustments to your investment strategy), but defining it is vital for investing.@@@
TextPage¤Risk@-1/&0/When we talk about risk there are many definitions (and we’ll go through them later in the course), but here we’re referring to how emotionally and financially sensitive YOU are to fluctuations of the value of your assets (especially when their value decreases).@-1/&0/Your risk tolerance influences the types of investments you choose, from high-risk stocks to low-risk bonds. Here's why you should pay attention to it when investing:# Firstly, knowing your comfort level with potential losses helps you make informed investment choices.@@@
TextPage¤Risk@-1/&0/Besides, you’ll see that higher risk often comes with the potential for higher returns, while lower risk usually means more modest gains. Understanding this tradeoff is key to building a balanced portfolio.@-1/&0/Furthermore, your risk tolerance should match your financial goals. For example, saving for a child's education may require a different risk approach than saving for retirement.@-1/&0/ Finally, markets are inherently volatile, and understanding the risks associated with economic cycles helps you stay focused on long-term goals regardless of short-term market movements. Being prepared for market downturns can prevent panic selling and poor decision-making.@@@
TextPage¤Returns@-1/&0/Returns represent the profit or loss on an investment over a specific period.@-1/&0/They are a direct measure of how well your investments are performing and allow you to compare the performance of different investments, helping you make informed decisions about where to allocate your resources.@-1/&0/ Besides, achieving your financial goals, such as retirement, buying a house, will depend on achieving certain returns. Knowing your required return helps in planning your investment strategy.@@@
TextPage¤Returns@-1/&0/Returns contribute to the compounding effect (which we'll describe later), where investment earnings generate additional earnings over time. This accelerates the growth of your investment portfolio.@-1/&0/And as we've already said (and we'll keep repeating), higher potential returns typically come with higher risk. Balancing the desire for higher returns with your risk tolerance is key to building a suitable portfolio.@-1/&0/ Finally, knowing the historical returns of various asset classes helps you make informed decisions about which investments align with your risk appetite.@@@
TextPage¤Allocation@-1/&0/Asset allocation refers to how you distribute your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash.@-1/&0/Allocation is a cornerstone of personal investing, essential for risk management, achieving financial goals, balancing risk and return, and adapting to life changes.# It allows you to respond to market conditions, improve financial discipline, optimize tax efficiency, and manage costs effectively.@-1/&0/We will go through this essential concept in more detail later, but bear in mind that by carefully allocating your assets, you can build a diversified portfolio that aligns with your objectives and maximizes your potential performance.@@@
