ListPage¤Risk Measures@-1/&0/For each bucket, relevant risk measures must be used:@-1/&0/@2&Assets in the personal risk bucket should be expected to appreciate at below-market rates. Suitable benchmarks are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3-month LIBOR. Suitable risk measures could use downside risk rather than volatility./Assets in the market risk bucket follow the standard Markowitz framework. Their performance can be compared to a standard equity index. Similarly, the Sharpe ratio* can be used to provide a suitable risk-adjusted measurement./Assets in the aspirational risk bucket should significantly outperform standard market indices when they succeed. Examples of such benchmarks could be a hedge fund index, or a large alpha over a standard market index. Other risk measures could incorporate default probabilities or use upside risk rather than volatility.@@@**
TextPage¤Consumer Price Index (CPI)@-1/&0/The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a benchmark that reflects changes in the cost of living and inflation.@-1/&0/By tracking the CPI, you can assess the real return on your investments, adjusting for the eroding effects of inflation on purchasing power.#For instance, if an investment yields 5% annually but the CPI indicates a 2% inflation rate, the real return is only 3%.@-1/&0/Monitoring the CPI helps you ensure your portfolio is generating sufficient returns to outpace inflation, maintaining the value of your assets in real terms.@@@
TextPage¤LIBOR@-1/&0/LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) serves as a benchmark risk measure, especially for those dealing with bonds and debt instruments.@-1/&0/It reflects the average rate at which major global banks lend to one another and is often used to set interest rates on various financial products like adjustable-rate mortgages, loans, and credit cards.#By tracking LIBOR, investors and borrowers can gauge the cost of borrowing and the potential impact on their loan payments.@-1/&0/Changes in LIBOR can signal shifts in market conditions, helping investors adjust their strategies to manage interest rate risk and maintain financial stability.@@@
TextPage¤Equity Indices@-1/&0/Equity indices, like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are critical benchmark risk measures in personal investment.@-1/&0/They represent the performance of a specific segment of the stock market and provide a snapshot of overall market trends.#By comparing their portfolio returns to these indices, investors can evaluate their investment performance relative to the broader market.@-1/&0/Equity indices also help investors assess the level of market risk and volatility, guiding decisions on asset allocation and risk management to align with their financial goals and risk tolerance.@@@
TextPage¤Sharpe Ratio@-1/&0/The Sharpe ratio is a widely-used benchmark risk measure that helps investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk.@-1/&0/It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate (such as the return on Treasury bonds) from the investment's return and then dividing by the investment's standard deviation (a measure of its volatility).#A higher Sharpe ratio indicates that the investment has a better risk-adjusted return, meaning it offers more return per unit of risk taken.@-1/&0/The Sharpe ratio allows you to compare different investments to determine which ones provide the best returns relative to their risk.@@@
TextPage¤Alpha@-1/&0/Alpha is a measure of an investment's performance relative to a benchmark index, typically representing the market.@-1/&0/It shows how much better or worse an investment has performed compared to the market average.#A positive alpha indicates that the investment has outperformed the market, while a negative alpha means it has underperformed.@-1/&0/Alpha helps investors assess the added value a fund manager or investment strategy brings, beyond what can be achieved through passive market exposure. By seeking investments with high alpha, investors aim to achieve superior returns.@@@
