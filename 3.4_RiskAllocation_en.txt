TextPage¤Risk Allocation@-1/&0/We all have complex wealth profiles.@-1/&0/You may have multiple (often conflicting) goals and constraints and your portfolios should include several different kinds of assets, all of which need to be considered simultaneously.@-1/&0/To deal with these seemingly conflicting goals, we use the concept of risk allocation.This comprehensive risk allocation framework expands the traditional MPT (market risk) model to include safety (personal risk) and aspirational components.@@@
ListPage¤Allocation Construction@-1/&0/Three important high-level questions need to be covered in order to build the right asset allocation:@2&What are my (personal, market, and aspirational) risk factors?/Do I have the correct risk allocation?/Do I have the right asset allocation within each risk bucket?@-1/&0/Accordingly, for each of the personal risk, market risk, and aspirational risk buckets, appropriate assets as well as appropriate risk-adjusted benchmarks need to be assigned.@@@
ImagePage¤Benchmarks@-1/&0/Investors should have very different performance expectations for the assets allocated to each of the three risk buckets, and these expectations must be benchmarked against appropriate indices. @0@-1/&0/@@@@
TextPage¤Expected Returns@-1/&0/Having a different benchmark for each of the three parts of the portfolio is important.@-1/&0/In the first bucket, one pays for and receives safety.In the third bucket, one gets outsized returns, unfortunately accompanied by a significant probability of loss of capital.@-1/&0/These two parts of the portfolio, in general, will behave differently than the central bucket, which can be benchmarked against risk-adjusted market indices.@@@
ListPage¤Risk Measures@-1/&0/For each bucket, relevant risk measures must be used:@1&Assets in the personal risk bucket should be expected to appreciate at below-market rates. Suitable benchmarks are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3-month LIBOR. Suitable risk measures could use downside risk rather than volatility./Assets in the market risk bucket follow the standard Markowitz framework. Their performance can be compared to a standard equity index. Similarly, the Sharpe ratio* can be used to provide a suitable risk-adjusted measurement./Assets in the aspirational risk bucket should significantly outperform standard market indices when they succeed. Examples of such benchmarks could be a hedge fund index, or a large alpha over a standard market index. Other risk measures could incorporate default probabilities or use upside risk rather than volatility.@15/1/123@@
