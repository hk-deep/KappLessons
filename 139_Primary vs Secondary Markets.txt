TextPage¤Primary vs Secondary Markets@-1/&0/When you buy a new sweater at the store, you're making a purchase on a primary market—that sweater had never been offered to the public before. Pick up a similar sweater at a thrift shop, and you've made a stop on the secondary market.@-1/&0/The financial markets also have primary and secondary markets.@-1/&0/The primary market is where new securities are issued, with the issuing companies and governments selling to financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers or directly to investors.#After that first issuance, wherever the security (a bond or a share of stock, for example) changes hands, it does so in a secondary market such as an exchange.@@@
ListPage¤Primary markets@-1/&0/The primary market is where new securities are issued for the first time. It’s the initial step in raising capital for corporations, governments, or other entities. The issuers exchange public securities for money from investors. The exact process varies with the type of security and the issuer’s preferences, but it usually follows one of the following models:@2&Initial public offering (IPO)/Auction/Direct listing/Private placement/Initial coin offerings@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Initial Public Offering (IPO)@-1/&0/When privately held companies go public, they frequently choose to offer their shares to the public for the first time through an IPO.@-1/&0/The company files a prospectus with their nation’s securities regulator (in the U.S., that’s the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC) to which investors can refer for more information.@-1/&0/Corporate bonds may be issued through a similar process.@@@
TextPage¤Auction@-1/&0/Usually government bonds are sold at auction.@-1/&0/A handful of financial institutions, known as primary dealers, submit competitive bids for bonds they wish to purchase and the rate they will accept.@-1/&0/Most participants are noncompetitive bidders, meaning that they agree to accept the rate determined by the competitive process.@@@
TextPage¤Direct listing@-1/&0/In contrast to an IPO, a direct listing (called a direct public offering or DPO) allows a company’s existing shares to be traded on an exchange without issuing new shares.#Companies sometimes go this route after several rounds of private funding through venture capital and private equity investors.@-1/&0/Founders, venture capital firms, and/or private equity investors trade their ownership interest among each other without listing in the public market.@-1/&0/These transactions are known as private equity secondaries.@@@
TextPage¤Private placement@-1/&0/In a private placement, a company issues stock or bonds to a small group of investors without going through the rigors of a public listing.@-1/&0/Private placement investors are typically of the “institutional” variety—pension funds, endowments, and high-net-worth investors.@@@
TextPage¤Initial coin offerings@-1/&0/In the cryptocurrency universe, an initial coin offering, or ICO, is an unregulated offering in which investors receive crypto coins or tokens in exchange for cash or other crypto assets.@-1/&0/The coins represent ownership—and perhaps voting rights—similar to shares of stock.@@@
TextPage¤Secondary markets@-1/&0/After securities are issued and stock listings are created, the new stocks and bonds trade on the secondary market. Even bank loans and investment products can be traded.@-1/&0/For example, the secondary mortgage market is robust. You can also purchase certificates of deposit (CDs) on a secondary market—just search any brokerage site for “brokered CDs.”@-1/&0/When you buy or sell a security on the secondary market, the trade is actually matched on an execution venue such as an exchange or OTC venue.@@@
TextPage¤Secondary markets@-1/&0/But individual investors don’t typically connect directly to the execution venue; we work with a broker. @-1/&0/Before electronic markets, this meant calling your broker or visiting the brokerage office, making a plan, and waiting hours or even days for the broker to execute the trade on the exchange. # Nowadays, you can buy and sell securities through an online brokerage platform or mobile app.@@@
TextPage¤How the primary and secondary markets work together@-1/&0/In finance, the secondary markets are generally more active than the primary markets. That’s because securities are fungible, meaning that one is as good as another. @-1/&0/Two shares of IBM stock are the same, no matter who owned them last or when they were issued to the public. # In the financial markets, secondary markets allow securities to trade long after the initial issuer receives funds. This robust market offers liquidity while helping assure issuers that there will be buyers the next time they come to the primary market.@@@
