TextPage¤Wealth Allocation@-1/&0/OK, so what now? How do I do that? Or, in financial language: Is there a framework that provides an optimum way of assuming risk, while still protecting oneself, in order to achieve or significantly increase affluence?@-1/&0/The short answer is YES.@-1/&0/But first, in order to understand how to successfully incorporate these diverse risk factors into your financial strategy, it is paramount to consider how wealth is measured on both absolute and relative scales.@@@
ImagePage¤Wealth Distribution@-1/&0/Individual investors consider their success and wealth not just in absolute terms, but also relative to their peers. @0@-1/&0/As is well known, wealth is unevenly distributed.

In order to move up in the wealth structure, you must acquire substantially, not incrementally, more wealth.#You cannot meet such an aspiration without taking on substantial risk, what we will call “aspirational risk.”@@@

We need a new framework that incorporates these aspects of safety and aspiration, while building upon the foundations of Modern Portfolio Theory.@@@
