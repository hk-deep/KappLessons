TextPage¤Wealth Allocation@-1/&0/OK, so what now? How do I do that?@-1/&0/Or, in financial language: Is there a framework that provides an optimum way of assuming risk, while still protecting oneself, in order to achieve or significantly increase affluence? The short answer is YES.#But first, in order to understand how to successfully incorporate these diverse risk factors into your financial strategy, it is paramount to consider how wealth is measured on both absolute and relative scales.@-1/&0/@@@
ImagePage¤Wealth Allocation@-1/&0/Individual investors consider their success and wealth not just in absolute terms, but also relative to their peers. @0@-1/&0/As is well known, wealth is unevenly distributed. If we divide the total wealth of households worldwide into three equal parts, we find that each third is approximately shared among 90%, 9%, and 1% of the households respectively. The shape of the wealth distribution is far from the usual symmetrical bell curve.@@@
ListPage¤Wealth Dynamics@-1/&0/At the very outset, it should be clear that every household, regardless of its current wealth, should :@2&Make sure it does not move leftwards (decrease its wealth percentile)./Keep up with its wealth group./Try to move rightwards (increase its relative wealth standing).@-1/&0/This is a non-trivial task. In order to move up in the wealth structure, you must acquire substantially, not incrementally, more wealth.#You cannot meet such an aspiration without taking on substantial risk, what we will call “aspirational risk.”@@@
TextPage¤Wealth Dilemma@-1/&0/On the surface, this risk-taking is at odds with the imperative to protect from falling to a lower wealth percentile.@-1/&0/It would seem reasonable to assume that most investors in this situation would pass up the opportunity for improvement in favor of the certainty of the status quo.#However, it is not so.@-1/&0/The conventional framework does not have the flexibility to accommodate the dual demands of safety and aspiration. We need a new framework that incorporates these aspects of safety and aspiration, while building upon the foundations of Modern Portfolio Theory.@@@
ListPage¤Allocation Framework@-1/&0/To consider a more comprehensive wealth strategy we will expand the definition of portfolio to cover all assets and liabilities such as investments, home, mortgage, and human capital. (Human capital can be loosely defined as earning potential.)#The objectives of your portfolio hence fall in one of the following three categories:@1&Protection from anxiety or poverty: We will refer to this as protection from personal risk./Ability to maintain your standard of living and status in society, i.e., keep up with family and friends. In order to do this, you must take on market risk./Opportunity to increase your wealth substantially. This involves taking on some aspirational risk.@@@
ListPage¤Decision Making@-1/&0/Another way of saying it is that there are three important factors that dominate decision making in the face of risk and return trade-offs, not just in finance, but across a wide variety of human decision making: certainty, probability, and possibility.#You must construct a portfolio that provides:@1&The certainty of protection from anxiety./The high probability of maintaining one’s standing./The possibility of substantially moving upwards in the wealth spectrum.@@@
ListPage¤Three Dimensions of Risk@-1/&0/MPT only recognizes market risk and seeks to minimize it through optimal asset allocation. In contrast, the wealth allocation framework identifies three very different risk dimensions and seeks to optimize all three of them simultaneously:@1&Personal Risk: You must protect yourself from personal risk. This means protecting yourself from anxiety regarding a dramatic decrease in your lifestyle./Market Risk: You need to take on market risk in order to grow with your wealth segment and maintain your lifestyle./Aspirational Risk: You could take on aspirational risk if you desire to break away from your wealth segment and enhance your lifestyle.@@@
ImagePage¤Dress accordingly@-1/&0/With that in mind, your portfolio of assets (including cash) should reflect these 3 dimensions of risk by incorporating 3 portfolios each of which addresses a different risk appetite: @1@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Wrap up@-1/&0/In summary, investors have different investing preferences based on their needs, fears, and aspirations:@2&Allocations to the personal risk bucket will limit loss of wealth, but will yield below-market returns./Allocations to the market risk bucket will provide risk-adjusted market returns (this is the MPT framework)./Allocations to the aspirational risk bucket should yield higher-than-market returns, but with the risk of substantial loss of capital.@@@
