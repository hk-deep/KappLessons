ListPage¤Major Types of Risks for Stocks@-1/&0/Investing, in general, comes with risks, but thoughtful investment selections that meet your goals and risk profile keep individual stock and bond risks at an acceptable level. However, other risks you have no control over are inherent in investing. Most of these risks affect the market or economy and require investors to adjust portfolios or ride out the storm.@2&Economic Risk/Inflationary Risk/Market Value Risk@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Economic Risk@-1/&0/One of the most obvious risks of investing is that the economy can go bad at any given moment.@-1/&0/For young investors, the best strategy is often to hunker down and ride out these downturns. If you believe in the long-term return of the capital markets and you are liquid at moments of crisis, you can use the temporarily lower prices to increase your positions in solid companies that perform well over the long term. This means buying more of the stocks you like at the bad times of the market.@-1/&0/Older investors are in a tighter bind. If you are in or near retirement, a major downturn in the stock market can be devastating if you haven't shifted significant assets to bonds or fixed-income securities. This is why diversification and adjusting your portfolio's asset allocation as you age is essential for investing.@@@
TextPage¤Inflationary Risk@-1/&0/Inflation is the tax on everyone, and if it's too high, it can destroy value and create recessions.@-1/&0/Investors have historically retreated to hard assets, such as real estate and precious metals, especially gold, in times of inflation, because they're likely to withstand the change.@-1/&0/But stocks may be the best protection against inflation since companies can adjust prices to the rate of inflation. A global recession may mean stocks will struggle for a protracted amount of time before the economy is strong enough to bear higher prices. It is not a perfect solution, but that is why even retired investors should maintain some of their assets in stocks.@@@
TextPage¤Market Value Risk@-1/&0/Market value risk refers to what happens when the market turns against or ignores some investment. It happens when the market goes off chasing the "next hot thing" and leaves many good, but unexciting companies behind.@-1/&0/It also happens when the market collapses because good stocks, as well as bad stocks, suffer as investors stampede out of the market.@-1/&0/Don't get caught with all your investments in one sector of the economy. By spreading your investments across several sectors, you have a better chance of participating in the growth of some of your stocks at any one time.@@@
