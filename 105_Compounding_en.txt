ImagePage¤The Magical Power of Compounding@-1/&0/Compounding is the magic that transforms small, consistent investments into substantial wealth over time. It involves earning returns not just on the initial investment but also on the accumulated interest or returns. @Magical@-1/&0/This exponential growth occurs as each period's gains contribute to the next. This is one of the most important concepts in personal investment.@@@
TextPage¤Explanation@-1/&0/The compounding effect is like a snowball rolling down a hill—it gets bigger and bigger as it goes.@-1/&0/In terms of money, it means you earn a return not just on your initial amount, but also on the interest you’ve already earned.# The idea is that the return on your investment is itself invested the next year and hence gives an extra return which can be reinvested, and so on, leading to exponential growth.@-1/&0/It works for all assets bearing a coupon, bonds (interest) as well as equities (dividends).@@@
ListPage¤Example@-1/&0/Imagine you have $100 in a savings account with an interest rate of 10% per year.@2&1. Year 1: You earn 10% on $100, which is $10. So, you have $110./2. Year 2: You earn 10% on $110, which is $11. Now, you have $121./3. Year 3: You earn 10% on $121, which is $12.10. Now, you have $133.10.@-1/&0/Each year, you earn interest on a larger amount of money because the interest from the previous years is added to your initial amount.@@@
