TextPage¤Market risk@-1/&0/Market risk, also known as systematic risk, encompasses the potential for investments to be affected by broader market fluctuations, such as economic downturns, geopolitical events, or changes in interest rates. @-1/&0/Unlike company-specific risks, which can be mitigated through diversification, market risk impacts entire asset classes or the overall market.@@@
TextPage¤Credit risk@-1/&0/Credit risk refers to the possibility of financial loss arising from the failure of a borrower to repay a debt obligation as agreed. This risk is prevalent in various lending scenarios, including bonds, loans, and credit derivatives. @-1/&0/ Factors influencing credit risk include the borrower's creditworthiness, financial stability, and the overall economic environment. @-1/&0/Credit risk can manifest in the form of default or delayed payments, leading to a decrease in the value of the investment or loss of income for the lender.@@@
TextPage¤Liquidity risk@-1/&0/Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to buy or sell an investment quickly without significantly impacting its price. It arises when there is a scarcity of buyers or sellers in the market, making it challenging to execute transactions at desired prices. @-1/&0/ Investments with higher liquidity risk may experience wider bid-ask spreads or price volatility during market stress periods. @-1/&0/This risk can be particularly concerning for investors who may need to access their funds urgently but find themselves unable to do so without incurring substantial losses.@@@
TextPage¤Interest rate risk@-1/&0/Interest rate risk refers to the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the value of fixed-income securities, such as bonds or loans. @-1/&0/When interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed-rate bonds typically decreases, as newer bonds with higher yields become available. # Conversely, when interest rates fall, the value of existing bonds may increase, as they offer higher yields compared to newly issued bonds. @-1/&0/Investors can mitigate interest rate risk by diversifying their fixed-income portfolios, investing in bonds with varying maturities.@@@
TextPage¤Currency risk@-1/&0/Currency risk, also known as exchange rate risk, refers to the potential for financial loss stemming from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. It affects investors who hold assets or liabilities denominated in a currency different from their domestic currency. @-1/&0/Currency risk arises when changes in exchange rates impact the value of investments, affecting returns or principal amounts. # For example, if an investor holds foreign stocks and the value of the domestic currency strengthens against the foreign currency, the returns from those stocks may decrease when converted back to the investor's currency.@@@
ImagePage¤Geopolitical risk@-1/&0/Geopolitical risk refers to the potential impact of political, social, or economic events on investment markets and assets.These risks arise from factors such as conflicts between nations, changes in government policies, trade disputes, or terrorist activities, which can disrupt global markets and affect investor sentiment. @0@-1/&0/Investors may mitigate geopolitical risk by diversifying their portfolios across different regions and asset classes, staying informed about geopolitical developments.@@@
