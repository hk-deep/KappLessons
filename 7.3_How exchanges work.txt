TextPage¤How Exchanges Work@-1/&0/When most people think of a stock exchange, they envision the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shouting brokers negotiating buys and sells via hand signals.@-1/&0/On a physical exchange like the NYSE, "market makers" who specialize in a particular stock will buy and sell that stock to brokers. The trading floor functions like an auction house, with bid and offer prices changing throughout the trading day. @-1/&0/But most exchanges have changed over to electronic trading platforms. Electronic exchanges work in a similar way, except that it's computers that connect buyers and sellers.@35/3/141@@

ImagePage¤The Order Book@-1/&0/Order books are used by almost every exchange for various assets like stocks, bonds, currencies, and even cryptocurrencies. @-1/&0/These lists help improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability, depth of trade, and who initiates transactions.@-1/&0/What it means is that if you want to trade on a security you go on the market where this security is listed, access the order book of this security, and enter your order (buy or sell, number of shares, and the price you’re willing to trade). And you can see what other buyers and sellers are willing to trade.@35/4/142@@
ListPage¤Order Types and Execution@-1/&0/Depending on your investing style, different types of orders can be used to trade stocks more effectively.@1&A market order simply buys (or sells) shares at the prevailing market prices until the order is filled./A limit order specifies a certain price at which the order must be filled, although there is no guarantee that some or all of the order will trade if the limit is set too high or low./Stop orders, a type of market order, are triggered when a stock moves above or below a certain level; they are often used as a way to insure against larger losses or to lock in profits./Orders that specify execution only at market open or market close are maintained separately. These are known as the “opening order” and “closing order” respectively.@-1/&0/@35/5/143@@
