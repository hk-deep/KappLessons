TextPage¤Simple@-1/&0/Mutual funds are easy to understand. Think of mutual funds as baskets of investments. Each basket holds dozens or hundreds of security types, such as stocks or bonds. When you buy a mutual fund, you buy a basket of investment securities. @-1/&0/Because they are easy, you can invest and succeed with mutual funds, no matter your skill level. They require no background in economics, financial statements, or financial markets. @-1/&0/There are many things to know about mutual funds, but compared to the broad world of financial products, mutual funds are quite easy to use and understand.@@@
TextPage¤Accessible@-1/&0/Mutual funds are easy to buy. @-1/&0/You can buy mutual funds from brokerage firms, online discount brokers, mutual fund companies, banks, and insurance firms. @-1/&0/Even novice investors can easily open an account in minutes at a no-load mutual fund company, such as Vanguard Investments.@@@
TextPage¤Diversified@-1/&0/Mutual funds have broad market exposure. @-1/&0/Diversification may be the greatest benefit of mutual funds. The beauty of investing in mutual funds is that you can buy one fund and obtain instant access to hundreds of individual stocks or bonds. @-1/&0/Otherwise, in order to diversify your portfolio, you might have to buy individual securities, which exposes you to more potential volatility. @-1/&0/However, it is smart to diversify into several different mutual funds.@@@
TextPage¤Varied@-1/&0/A mutual fund comes in many types and styles. @-1/&0/There are stock funds, bond funds, sector funds, target-date mutual funds, money market mutual funds, and balanced funds. @-1/&0/Mutual funds allow you to invest in the market whether you believe in active portfolio management (actively managed funds) or you prefer to buy a segment of the market with no interference from a manager (passive funds and index mutual funds). @-1/&0/The availability of different types of mutual funds allows you to build a diversified portfolio at a low cost and without much difficulty.@@@
TextPage¤Affordable@-1/&0/Mutual funds have low minimums. @-1/&0/Many mutual fund companies allow investors to get started in a mutual fund with as little as $1,000. @-1/&0/And since mutual funds can be easily traded, the combination of low cost and ease of use makes them accessible.@@@
TextPage¤Low Expense@-1/&0/Mutual funds can cost less to manage than other portfolio types. @-1/&0/Costs as a percentage of assets in the portfolio may be lower for an actively managed mutual fund when compared to an actively managed portfolio of individual securities. @-1/&0/When you add up transaction costs, annual fees paid to a brokerage firm, and the cost for research tools or investment advice, mutual funds are often cheaper than the typical portfolio of stocks. @-1/&0/Certain factors may affect the cost to manage a portfolio of mutual funds. These include the fund's expenses, trading volume, size of transaction, and taxes.@@@
TextPage¤Professional Management@-1/&0/Mutual funds have a team of professionals who research investments so you don't have to. @-1/&0/Many investors don’t have the resources or time to buy individual stocks. This is where professional management is valuable. @-1/&0/Investing in individual securities, such as stocks, not only takes resources but a considerable amount of time. @-1/&0/By contrast, mutual fund managers and analysts wake up each morning dedicating their professional lives to researching and analyzing current and potential holdings for their mutual fund.@@@
