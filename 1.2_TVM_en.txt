ImagePage¤How inflation works@-1/&0/Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, meaning that a set amount of money will buy fewer goods in the future, i.e. the same dollar in your pocket might buy you less stuff in a year’s time. @1@-1/&0/That’s why you have to account for inflation when making financial decisions and factor in that future cash flows are less valuable than their present counterparts in financial calculations.@@@
