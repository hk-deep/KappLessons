TextPage¤Understanding the Order Book@-1/&0/Order books are used by almost every exchange to list the orders for different assets like stocks, bonds, and currencies. These orders can be both manual or electronic. #Although they generally contain the same information, the set up may be slightly different depending on the source. @-1/&0/Buy and sell information may appear on the top and bottom, or on the left and right side of the screen. @-1/&0/An order book is dynamic, meaning it's constantly updated in real-time throughout the day.@@@
TextPage¤Reading an Order Book@-1/&0/There are typically three parts to an order book: buy orders, sell orders, and order history. #Buy orders contain buyer information including all the bids, the amount they wish to purchase. #Sell orders resemble buy orders, but instead include all the offers (or asking prices) or where people are willing to sell. @-1/&0/Market order histories show all the transactions that have taken place in the past. @-1/&0/The top of the book is where you'll find the highest bid and lowest ask prices.

TextPage¤The Order Book Explained@-1/&0/The order book: it is divided into two columns: buying and selling. Within each of them are the 5 best offers (selling) and the 5 best bids (buying), the proposed prices, the number of securities, and the number of orders proposed. @-1/&0/In the example, you can see that the best buy orders are at 701.5 dollars for a total size of 1809 securities, and the second best sell orders at 701.4 euros for 2466 securities, etc. As for the sellers, you find the best sell order at 701.7 dollars for 2390 securities, the second best sell order at 701.8 dollars for 4476 securities, etc. @-1/&0/So if you want to buy a security you have the choice between either hitting the offer, in this case 701.7 dollars, or enter a buy order below that price and wait to be hit by a potential seller. Conversely if you want to sell the security you can either hit the best bid, in this case 701.5 dollars, or enter a sell order above this price and wait to be hit by a potential buyer.@@@
