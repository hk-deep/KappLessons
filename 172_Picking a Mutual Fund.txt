TextPage¤Picking a Mutual Fund@-1/&0/If you have made a decision to include mutual funds in your investment strategy, but don't know how to get started, it's actually pretty easy with just a bit of due diligence on your part. @-1/&0/You can get halfway there just by understanding your own tolerance for risk and getting clear on your investment objectives. @-1/&0/Picking mutual funds involves choosing those that provide good returns at a low cost. Once you're ready to choose some mutual funds, there are ways to analyze them, such as looking at each fund's past performance history, management team, and expense ratios. You can also entertain different investment strategies that will drive your fund choices.@@@
ListPage¤Start With Your Goals and Risk Tolerance@-1/&0/As an investor, you'll have upwards of 10,000 mutual funds from a plethora of fund management companies to choose from, so it helps to set some goals to narrow the field. Ask yourself the following questions to gain some clarity on your investing goals:@2&Are you looking for current income or long-term appreciation (capital gains)?/Does the money need to fund a college education or accumulate for a far-off retirement?/Can you tolerate a portfolio that may have extreme ups and downs?/Are you more comfortable with a conservative investment strategy?/Do you need your funds to be liquid in the near future?/Are you investing money that you can afford to have tucked away for many years?@@@
TextPage¤Pay Attention to the Expense Ratio@-1/&0/It takes money to run a mutual fund. The percentage of assets that go toward the management advisory fee and basic operating expenses is known as the expense ratio. @-1/&0/In short, it is the cost of owning the fund. Think of it as the amount a mutual fund has to earn just to break even before it can even begin to start growing your money. @-1/&0/All else being equal, you want to own funds that have the lowest possible expense ratio. Over time, these seemingly paltry percentages can result in a huge difference in how your wealth grows.@@@
TextPage¤Avoid Mutual Funds With High Turnover Ratios@-1/&0/It’s important to focus on the turnover rate—that is, the percentage of the portfolio that is bought and sold each year—for any mutual fund you are considering. @-1/&0/The reason is that age-old bane of our existence: taxes. #If you are investing solely through a tax-free account, this is not a consideration, nor does it matter if you manage the investments for a non-profit.@-1/&0/For everyone else, however, taxes can take a huge bite out of the proverbial pie, especially if you are fortunate enough to occupy the upper rungs of the income ladder. You should be wary of funds that habitually turnover 50% or more of their portfolio.@@@
TextPage¤Look for an Experienced, Disciplined Management Team@-1/&0/If you find yourself holding a mutual fund with a manager that has little or no track record or, even worse, a history of massive losses when the stock market as a whole has performed well, consider running as fast as you can in the other direction. @-1/&0/The ideal situation is a firm that is founded on one or more strong investment analysts/portfolio managers that have built a team of talented and disciplined individuals around them. @-1/&0/Finally, check to see if the managers have a substantial portion of their net worth invested alongside the fund holders.@@@
TextPage¤Buy No-Load Mutual Funds@-1/&0/Some mutual funds charge what is known as a sales load. @-1/&0/This is a fee, up to 5% of assets, that is paid to the person who sells you the fund. @-1/&0/It can be a great way to make money if you are a wealth manager, but if you are putting together a portfolio, you should only buy no-load mutual funds.@@@
TextPage¤Know the Appropriate Benchmark for Your Mutual Funds@-1/&0/Each fund has a different approach and goal. That’s why it’s important to know what you should compare it against to know whether your portfolio manager is doing a good job. @-1/&0/For example, if you own a balanced fund that keeps 50% of its assets in stocks and 50% in bonds, you should be thrilled with a return of 10% even if the broader market did 14%. @-1/&0/Adjusted for the risk you took with your capital, returns were stellar!@@@
ListPage¤Work Toward Ample Diversification of Assets@-1/&0/It’s vitally important that you spread your assets out among different companies, sectors, and industries. Simply owning four different mutual funds specializing in the financial sector, for example, is not diversification. Were something to hit those funds on the scale of the real-estate collapse of the early 1990’s, your portfolio would be hit hard.@2@-1/&0/Here are some rough guidelines:&Don’t own funds that make heavy sector or industry bets./Don’t keep all of your funds within the same fund family./Don’t just think stocks.@@@
TextPage¤The Case for Index Funds@-1/&0/For the average investor who has a decade or longer to invest and wants to regularly put aside money to compound over time, index funds can be a great choice. @-1/&0/They combine almost unfathomably low turnover rates with rock-bottom expense ratios and widespread diversification; in other words, you really can have your cake and eat it, too.@@@
TextPage¤Use Dollar Cost Averaging@-1/&0/You may have heard this multiple times, but dollar cost averaging really is the single best way to lower your risk over long periods of time and help lower your overall cost basis for your investments. @-1/&0/It consists of making regular periodic investments, usually of the same amount, into one or more mutual funds of your choice. @-1/&0/Over time, that keeps the average cost basis of your shares lower, and you can build a larger stock position without feeling the effects in your wallet.@@@
