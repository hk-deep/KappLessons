ListPage¤Types of Stock@-1/&0/When most people think of stocks, they typically think of publicly listed shares traded on the stock exchange. However, it's important to know the different types of stocks available, understand their unique characteristics, and be able to determine when they may represent a suitable investment.#Below, we outline the various stock categories, aiming to take the confusion out of differing stock classes on offer to investors.@1&Common and Preferred Stock/Growth Stocks vs. Value Stocks/Blue-Chip vs Small Cap Stocks/Cyclical and Non-Cyclical Stocks@-1/&0/@@@
TextPage¤Common Stock@-1/&0/Common stock—sometimes referred to as ordinary shares—represents partial ownership in a company. This stock class entitles investors to generated profits, usually paid in dividends. @-1/&0/Common stockholders elect a company's board of directors and vote on corporate policies.# Holders also have rights to the company's assets in a liquidation event, but only after preferred stock shareholders and other debt holders have been paid.@-1/&0/Company founders and employees typically receive common stock.@@@
TextPage¤Preferred Stock@-1/&0/Preferred stocks are like a mix between a common stock and a bond. They typically provide regular income through higher-than-average dividend payments, like a bond might with interest payments.@-1/&0/Their shares also grant you ownership of a company like common stocks and may appreciate in value as the company becomes more desirable.# And "convertible preferred stock" may be converted to common shares by the company or by you if certain conditions are met.@-1/&0/Unlike common stocks, preferred stocks don't come with shareholder voting rights.# Another difference: they have preferred status to receive payment when a company goes bankrupt and sells its holdings to pay off its debts and compensate its owners.@@@
TextPage¤Growth Stocks@-1/&0/Growth stocks are shares of companies expected to grow quickly and rapidly increase their price. Usually, growth stocks belong to smaller, newer companies, like tech companies, that have a lot of potential but not a lot of profit.@-1/&0/Growth stocks typically don't pay dividends, as the companies may prefer to invest extra cash in themselves to grow faster.# Growth stocks tend to have stock prices that are much higher than you might expect compared to their actual earnings.@-1/&0/When you buy one, you're hoping that company's performance eventually catches up to the expectations of its share price.# There's no guarantee that a growth company will get there.# And if it doesn't, investor favor may fade, sending prices down.# This makes them riskier investments.@@@
TextPage¤Value Stocks@-1/&0/Value stocks on the other hand are associated with companies that investors think trade below what they're really worth, based on their earnings. They tend to be larger, more established companies with solid financial histories.@-1/&0/Some even pay dividends.@-1/&0/If you own a value stock, you're hoping the market eventually realizes the stock is undervalued, and its price bounces up.# If it doesn't, you may be left holding a stock with good financial fundamentals but that never realizes its potential.@@@
TextPage¤Cyclical Stocks@-1/&0/National economies tend to follow cycles of expansion and contraction, with periods of prosperity and recession. Certain businesses have greater exposure to broad business cycles, and investors therefore refer to them as cyclical stocks.@-1/&0/Cyclical stocks are directly affected by the economy's performance and typically follow economic cycles of expansion, peak, recession, and recovery.# Cyclical stocks include shares of companies in industries like manufacturing, travel, and luxury goods, because an economic downturn can take away customers' ability to make major purchases quickly.@-1/&0/When economies are strong, however, a rush of demand can make these companies rebound sharply.# They usually display more volatility and outperform other stocks in times of economic strength when consumers have more discretionary income.@@@
TextPage¤Non-Cyclical Stocks@-1/&0/By contrast, non-cyclical stocks, also known as defensive stocks, don't have those big swings in demand. Non-cyclical stocks operate in "recession-proof" industries that tend to perform reasonably well irrespective of the economy.@-1/&0/An example of non-cyclical stocks would be grocery store chains, because no matter how good or bad the economy is, people still have to eat.@-1/&0/Non-cyclical stocks tend to perform better during market downturns, while cyclical stocks often outperform during strong bull markets.@@@
ListPage¤Stock Industry Sectors@-1/&0//You can also classify stocks based on the characteristics of the companies that issued them. These different groupings meet the varying needs of shareholders./Stocks can be grouped by industry sector, including:@1&Basic materials: Companies that extract natural resources/Conglomerates: Global companies in different industries/Consumer goods: Companies that provide goods to sell at retail to the general public/Financial: Banks, insurance, and real estate companies/Healthcare: Healthcare providers, health insurance, medical equipment suppliers, and drug companies/Industrial Goods: Manufacturing companies/Services: Companies that get products to consumers/Technology: Computers and software/Utilities: Electric, gas, and water companies@-1/&0/@@@
ListPage¤Market capitalization@-1/&0/Market cap is a way of referring to the size of a company in a manner that allows you to compare companies in different industries. It is computed by multiplying the existing number of shares of a company by their market price. Investors categorize companies under one of these labels although there is no universal agreement on the exact cutoffs:@1&Micro-cap: up to $300 million/Small-cap: $300 million to $2 billion/Mid-cap: $2 billion to $10 billion/Large-cap: $10 billion to $200 billion/Mega-cap: More than $200 billion@-1/&0/These rankings are completely arbitrary and other sources may use different numbers.@@@
TextPage¤Blue-Chips@-1/&0/Blue-chip stocks are well-established companies that have a large market capitalization.@-1/&0/They have a long successful track record of generating dependable earnings and leading within their industry or sector.@-1/&0/Conservative investors may top-weight their portfolio with blue-chip stocks, particularly in periods of uncertainty. Several examples of blue-chip stocks include computing giant Microsoft, fast-food leader McDonald's, and energy mammoth Exxon Mobil.@@@
TextPage¤Medium and Small Cap Stocks@-1/&0/Size matters in the marketplace. Small companies are riskier than larger companies are. They have shorter lifespans unless they grow or merge with a larger company.@-1/&0/However, with risk comes the potential for reward. Small-cap stocks can outperform all other size stocks under certain market conditions, so many investors carry a small portion of them in their portfolios.@-1/&0/Small companies that grow to be big companies (like Microsoft and Apple) can make early investors very wealthy, but most don't. Large companies can protect their market share and fend off competitors more easily.@@@
