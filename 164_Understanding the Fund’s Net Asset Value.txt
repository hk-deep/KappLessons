TextPage¤Understanding the Fund’s Net Asset Value@-1/&0/Mutual funds are pooled investments, and the Net Asset Value (NAV) measures the total value of all the investments that have been pooled together in the fund. #Mutual funds use the NAV to represent the unit—per share—price of owning a share of the fund. @-1/&0/The NAV is recalculated once per day, and any trade orders placed within the past day will execute at the price determined by the new NAV. @-1/&0/Net asset value, along with any dividends you receive from your investment, will impact your portfolio's total return in the long-run, but beware the NAV does not correlate to the financial soundness of the underlying investments in the mutual fund.@@@
TextPage¤How Mutual Funds Are Structured@-1/&0/Mutual funds are types of pooled funds. This means the fund manager will collect all individual investments and then invest that money into other assets. #The assets that a mutual fund invests in will align with the stated goal of that particular fund. All these different assets impact the price of shares in a mutual fund. @-1/&0/The stocks, bonds, and other securities held as investments by a mutual fund will trade throughout the day, and their price will move in accordance with trading activity. @-1/&0/Net asset value (NAV) is the net worth or book value—calculated as asset less any liabilities—of the mutual fund based upon the closing prices of the underlying investment the fund owners.@@@
TextPage¤Using NAV to Set Share Price@-1/&0/Mutual funds must calculate their NAV once per day, and typically this happens after the markets close. @-1/&0/The buying and selling activity of a mutual fund happens once a day to protect investors from rapid market moves. #At EOD (End-Of-Day), the value of a mutual fund's underlying positions is added up by accounting firms based upon the closing price of the stock market and other exchanges. @-1/&0/This value is used to determine the value of all the mutual fund's holdings.@@@
TextPage¤Using NAV to Set Share Price@-1/&0/Any debts or liabilities of the mutual fund, such as stock that is sold short, is deducted to calculate the net asset value. @-1/&0/The stock exchanges then update the share price of the mutual fund to reflect this new NAV. #Because the value of the fund's assets and liabilities, as well as the number of shares available, change daily, the NAV also changes daily. @-1/&0/This net asset value is the price at which investors can buy or sell their shares at the end of each trading day.@@@
TextPage¤Executing Orders for Mutual Funds@-1/&0/Any orders that you place to buy or sell mutual fund shares are aggregated and settled at EOD. @-1/&0/For example, if you sell 1,000 shares of an index fund at 11:32 a.m., you won't know the price you are going to receive for those shares, or get your money until EOD (4:00 p.m. in the US) that afternoon when the NAV is calculated. @-1/&0/This is the reason you never see the prices of traditional mutual funds throughout the trading day. The NAV is only determined at the end of the trading day.@@@
TextPage¤What Net Asset Value Can't Tell You@-1/&0/While NAV is an important measure of the value of a mutual fund, it doesn't tell you everything you need to know about a fund's performance, value, or potential place in your portfolio. #Net asset value does not account for the sometimes significant unrealized capital gains exposure that has sometimes built up within an older mutual fund or index fund. It also can't tell you if the actual intrinsic value of the underlying holdings is reasonable or not. @-1/&0/While NAV is an important element of mutual fund trading for investors to understand, it is not a replacement for other information about the mutual fund. @-1/&0/Before you invest, look into a mutual fund's reputation, performance, goals, and long-term value to help you determine whether it is a good fit for your investment portfolio.@@@
