ListPage¤Risk Measurement@-1/&0/If you want to assess the likelihood and impact of adverse outcomes you’ll find various ways to quantify Risk, depending on what you want to measure :@1&Standard deviation measures the dispersion of returns around the average, indicating volatility./Beta measures how much an asset’s movements are correlated to the overall market movements. It reflects the systematic risk of the asset./Value at Risk (VaR) estimates the maximum potential loss within a specified confidence level./Credit risk measures the likelihood of a default by the issuer on the bond you hold.@-1/&0/By understanding these measurements, investors can better evaluate and manage risk in their portfolios.@6/3/114@@
TextPage¤Standard Deviation@-1/&0/Standard deviation is a statistical measure. For a given set of data, it quantifies how much the data points are different from the mean value. #In finance, standard deviation is commonly used as a measure of investment risk. # A higher standard deviation indicates greater volatility or variability in the returns of an investment, suggesting a higher level of risk. @-1/&0/Conversely, a lower standard deviation implies more stable returns and lower risk. @-1/&0/Investors use standard deviation to assess the historical volatility of an investment and to make informed decisions.@@@
TextPage¤Beta@-1/&0/Beta is a measure of a financial asset's sensitivity to movements in the broader market. #It quantifies the degree of systematic risk inherent in an investment. # A beta of 1 indicates that the asset's price tends to move in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 suggests that the asset is more volatile than the market. @-1/&0/Conversely, a beta less than 1 indicates that the asset is less volatile than the market, and a beta of zero indicates that the asset is not correlated at all to the market. @-1/&0/Beta is commonly used by investors to assess the risk of individual securities or portfolios.@@@
TextPage¤Value at Risk@-1/&0/Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure used to quantify the potential loss in the value of an investment or portfolio over a specific time horizon and at a given confidence level. @-1/&0/It estimates the maximum loss that an investment or portfolio could suffer under normal market conditions within a certain probability. # For example, a 95% VaR of $1 million over one day implies that there is a 5% chance that the investment or portfolio could lose more than $1 million in value within a single trading day. @-1/&0/VaR helps investors and risk managers assess the potential downside risk of their investments, set risk limits, and develop risk management strategies.@@@
TextPage¤Credit spread@-1/&0/A credit spread refers to the difference in yield or interest rates between two fixed-income securities, typically bonds, with similar maturities but differing credit qualities. @-1/&0/It represents the additional yield that investors demand for holding a bond with higher credit risk compared to a bond with lower credit risk. # The credit spread reflects the market's perception of the issuer's creditworthiness and the likelihood of default. @-1/&0/Widening credit spreads indicate increased perceived credit risk, while narrowing spreads suggest improved credit conditions.@@@
